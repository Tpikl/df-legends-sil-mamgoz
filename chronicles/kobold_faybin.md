# Faybin

> *A chronicle of the kobold pack - from cave dwellers to undead thralls*

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Entity ID** | #28 |
| **Race** | Kobold |
| **Type** | Civilization |
| **Founded** | Before Year 1 (cave dwellers) |
| **Status** | **Subjugated** - Surviving members are undead thralls |
| **Population** | 105 kobolds (general population) |
| **Historical Figures** | 10 alive (undead), 18 dead |

### Brief Summary
Faybin is the only kobold civilization in Sil Mamgoz. Originally a small pack living in the cave of Commongutters, the kobolds were massacred by the titan Umbrallilac in Year 17 - every adult and child slain in a single devastating attack. For 217 years, only their general population survived without historical figures. Then, in Year 234, the dwarf necromancer Sodel Severeoils raised the 10 founding adults from the dead. These undead kobolds now serve as his thralls, residing in the abandoned dwarf hillocks of Chamberland. They worship no kobold gods - instead, they adopted the deities of dwarves and humans, making their religion as borrowed as their current existence.

## Geography & Territory

### Current Holdings

**None.** All sites are abandoned.

### Original Territory

| Site | Type | Years Held | Fate |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| Commongutters (#4) | Cave | Before Year 1 - Year 17 | **ABANDONED** - Wiped out by titan |

### Current Residence (Not Owned)

| Site | Type | Owner | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| Chamberland (#16) | Hillocks | None (abandoned) | 10 undead kobolds reside here as of Year 500 |

### Territorial Notes
- Commongutters was a natural cave at coordinates 12,31 - small and remote
- Chamberland was built by The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence (dwarf entity #26) before their fall
- The kobolds never "owned" Chamberland - they were placed there by their necromancer master
- All 10 undead kobolds share buildings within the hillocks

## Government & Structure

### Leadership Positions

The kobolds had no documented leadership positions. They existed as a simple pack without formal titles or hierarchy.

### Entity Structure

| Entity | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Faybin (#28) | Civilization | Main kobold civilization |
| Thofolobogus (#29) | Sitegovernment | Cave settlement government |

### Current Status

The surviving kobolds are not free agents. They serve as thralls to:

| Master | Figure | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Sodel Severeoils | #219 | Dwarf necromancer, knows SECRET_17 (undead resurrection) |

All 10 undead kobolds have an `intrigue_actor` relationship with Sodel as "master" and their strategy as "obey."

## Religion & Culture

### Pantheon Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Deity Count** | 0 (native) / 16 (adopted) |
| **Primary Faith** | Polytheistic (borrowed) |
| **Native Deities** | None |
| **Religious Organizations** | None |

**Critical Note:** The kobolds have NO gods of their own. They adopted the gods of the dwarves and humans they encountered - a syncretistic faith cobbled together from their neighbors.

### Most Worshipped Deities

| Deity | Race | Spheres | Worshippers | Notes |

| Risen (#46) | Dwarf | Earth | 8/10 | Common worship |
| Various Human Gods (#84-93) | Human | Mixed | Variable | Lower strength |

### Cultural Practices
- **Craft Skills**: Stonecraft, bonecarving, mining - utilitarian cave-dwelling skills
- **Stealth Skills**: High sneak, trapping, dodging - typical kobold survival tactics
- **Social Skills**: Persuasion, negotiation, conversation - surprisingly diplomatic
- **No Art Forms**: No music, poetry, or dance documented

## Current State

### Population

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **General Population** | 105 kobolds | Living, free kobolds |
| **Historical Figures (Undead)** | 10 | Thralls of Sodel Severeoils |
| **Historical Figures (Dead)** | 18 | Children killed in Year 17 |

### The Undead Ten

All residing at Chamberland (#16), buildings 3, 4, 6, 7:

| Figure | Status | Master |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Stlabafatrayrbin | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |
| Shaymin | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |
| Pigis | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |
| Brarbis | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |
| Tholostaris | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |
| Loflilis | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |
| Shrigikilubus | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |
| Gilisreembus | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |
| Chrikrilbis | Undead Thrall | Sodel Severeoils |

### Entity Affiliations

The undead kobolds show complex entity history:
- **Former member** of Faybin (#28) - strength 1 (nearly forgotten)
- **Former member** of Thofolobogus (#29) - strength 1
- **Former member** of The Crystalline Knights (#52) - their master's faction

### Prospects

**Grim.** The kobold civilization exists in a fractured state:
- The 10 undead have no free will - they serve a dwarf necromancer
- The 105 living kobolds have no historical figures to lead them
- No territory, no government, no autonomy
- Their adopted religion offers no salvation - they worship the gods of races that ignore or despise them
