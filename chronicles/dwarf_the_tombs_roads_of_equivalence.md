# The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence

> *A chronicle of dwarven endurance in the Plane of Dragons*

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Entity ID** | #26 |
| **Race** | Dwarf |
| **Type** | Civilization |
| **Founded** | Year 1 (First recorded history) |
| **Status** | **Lost** - Fallen to civil war |
| **Capital** | Longpaints (#8) - Lost in Year 162 |
| **Population** | 312 dwarves (refugees) |

### Brief Summary
The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence was the sole dwarven civilization in Sil Mamgoz. Once a proud kingdom of fortresses and hillocks, it has been completely destroyed - not by external enemies, but by civil war. The Crystalline Knights (#52), a rebellious dwarf faction, systematically conquered every settlement between Years 159-501. The original fortress of Longpaints fell in Year 162. The last two sites, founded in Year 500 as a desperate attempt to rebuild, were destroyed and abandoned within a year. Today, 312 dwarves remain as a scattered population without a home, their civilization marked as "Lost" in the annals of history.

## Religion & Culture

### Pantheon Overview

|-------|-------|
| **Deity Count** | 6 |
| **Primary Faith** | Polytheistic |
| **Dominant Themes** | Mountains, fortresses, craft, earth, wealth |

The dwarves worship six gods, three female and three male. Reg, goddess of fortresses and war, is the most prominent - two of the three formal religions are devoted to her. The pantheon reflects dwarven values: defensive architecture, mineral wealth, and the earth that shelters them.

## Wars & Conflicts

### The Minotaur Azmol (Year 3 and beyond)

**Azmol Tunneledclubs "The Livid Bristles" (#105)** - A female minotaur born in Year -159 - attacked Longpaints in Year 3.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Species | Minotaur |
| Born | Year -159 |
| Status | Alive (660+ years old) |
| Known Kills | 2+ dwarves at Longpaints |
| Lair | Site #60 |
| Enemies | Most dwarf and human entities |

**Combat Skills:** Azmol is an ancient master warrior with exceptional skills in Hammer (12694), Mace (12142), Spear (12067), and Situational Awareness (17509). She remains a threat to all civilizations.

**Dwarf Casualties at Longpaints (Year 3):**
- Logem Oversabre (#133) - struck
- Olon Cloutmerchants (#124) - wounded, then struck

### The Crystalline Knights Civil War (Years 159-501)

**The Crystalline Knights (#52)** - A rebellious dwarf faction - waged a systematic war of conquest against The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence, ultimately destroying the civilization entirely.

| Year | Event | Site | Outcome |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| 159 | Conquest | Chamberland (#16) | Taken, new government #56 installed |
| 162 | Conquest | **Longpaints (#8)** | **Capital falls**, new government #58 installed |
| 192 | Conquest | Chamberland (#16) | Retaken again after reclaim attempt |
| 234 | Conquest | Site #4 | Taken from nomadic group |
| 500 | Attack | Swordreveres (#76) | **Destroyed** (same year as founding!) |
| 501 | - | Violentwhipped (#77) | Retired/abandoned (final site) |

**The Fall of Longpaints (Year 162):**
The conquest of the original fortress marked the effective end of the civilization. The Orb Of Heroes (#27), the founding site government, was overthrown. The Crystalline Knights installed their own government (#58).

**The Year 500 Tragedy:**
The Tombs-Roads attempted a desperate comeback, founding two new fortresses (Swordreveres and Violentwhipped). The Crystalline Knights responded immediately - Swordreveres was destroyed the same year it was founded. Violentwhipped was abandoned the following year, marking the final end of the civilization.

### Creature Attacks at Longpaints

The fortress has faced ongoing creature attacks:

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 3 | Minotaur attack (2 dead) |
| 6 | Attack - Figure #164 killed by Figure #1 |
| 10 | Multiple creatures devoured victims |

---

## Current State

### Population
- **Total Population:** 312 dwarves (scattered refugees)
- **Historical Figures:** 434 documented (status unknown)
- **Status:** **LOST** - Civilization has fallen

### Territory
| Type | Count | Sites |
|------|-------|-------|
| Fortresses | 0 | All lost |
| Hillocks | 0 | All lost |
| **Total** | 0 | No remaining territory |

### What Happened
The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence suffered a complete collapse:

1. **Early History (Years 1-42):** Promising start, but hillocks repeatedly destroyed by titans, hydras, and the roc Litast
2. **The Civil War (Years 159-162):** The Crystalline Knights conquered all remaining sites, including the capital Longpaints
3. **The Exile (Years 163-499):** Survivors existed as scattered refugees with no home
4. **The Final Attempt (Year 500-501):** Two new fortresses founded in desperation; both lost within a year

### The Crystalline Knights
The true destroyers of the Tombs-Roads were not external enemies, but fellow dwarves. The Crystalline Knights (#52) systematically conquered every settlement and now control the former dwarf territory. The nature of this rebellion - ideological, dynastic, or opportunistic - remains unclear.

### Prospects
The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence is **extinct as a territorial entity**. While 312 dwarves survive in the general population, they have no settlements, no functioning government, and no territory. The Crystalline Knights have proven willing to destroy any attempt to rebuild. Without divine intervention or a dramatic reversal, this civilization will not recover.

## Comparison to Other Civilizations

| Aspect | Dwarves | Humans | Elves |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Founded | Year 1 | Year 1 | Year 1 |
| Population | 312 (homeless) | 372 (homeless) | 20 (homeless) |
| Active Sites | **0** (all lost) | **0** (all abandoned) | **0** (all abandoned) |
| Deities | 6 | 10 | 1 |
| Night Creature Victims | 0 | 6+ | 3+ |
| Status | **LOST** | **LOST** | **LOST** |
| Primary Threat | Civil war (The Crystalline Knights) | Night creatures, megabeasts | Titans, night creatures |

**The End of All Things:** Every civilization in Sil Måmgoz has been marked as "Lost." The dwarves fell to civil war, the humans to monster predation, and the elves to titans and night creatures. While populations survive (704 total: 372 humans, 312 dwarves, 20 elves), not a single active settlement remains. The world's three civilizations are now scattered, homeless survivors.
