# Pantheon of The Bewildering Nation

> *"They pray to gods of truth while monsters wearing their kin's faces hunt them in the night."*

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Civilization** | The Bewildering Nation (Entity #32) |
| **Race** | Human |
| **Number of Deities** | 10 |
| **Primary Faith** | Polytheistic |
| **Religious Organizations** | None documented |

### Theological Summary
The human pantheon is a study in contradictions. Gods of civilization (Iguk - laws, oaths) stand alongside dark patrons (Luthi - sacrifice, thralldom). A god of truth (Pabat) watches over a people plagued by night creature deception. Most troubling: the goddess of deformity (Agwa) is the most fervently worshipped deity among transformed former humans, suggesting her faith may have invited their corruption.

## The Deities

### The Nurturer

#### Tunem Divedfords "The Natural Fin" (Figure #84)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Female |
| **Spheres** | Food, Agriculture |
| **Epithets** | "The Natural Fin" |

**Description:**
The provider goddess, Tunem represents humanity's agricultural foundations. Her epithet "The Natural Fin" may reference fishing or water's role in farming. She embodies sustenance and the earth's bounty.

---

### The Avenger

#### Nasnok "The Dented Barb" (Figure #85)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Female |
| **Spheres** | Revenge |

**Description:**
A dark goddess of vengeance. Her epithet "The Dented Barb" evokes a weapon worn from use - justice through violence. Notably, the monster Slibtu still worships Nasnok (strength 9), perhaps justifying her centuries of killing as righteous payback.

**Corrupted Worshippers:**
- Slibtu "The Cavernous Abyss" - strength 9
- Mogem "The Sable" - strength 39

---

### The Stargazer

#### Osman "The Labyrinthine Fogs" (Figure #86)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Female |
| **Spheres** | Stars |
| **Epithets** | "The Labyrinthine Fogs" |

**Description:**
Goddess of the night sky, navigation, and perhaps fate. Her epithet suggests mystery - the stars seen through mist, their patterns a maze to interpret. She guides travelers and seers.

**Corrupted Worshippers:**
- Mogem "The Sable" - strength 13

---

### The Keeper of Secrets

#### Islas Dawnlantern "The Glowing Crypts" (Figure #87)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Male |
| **Spheres** | Death, Day |
| **Epithets** | "Dawnlantern", "The Glowing Crypts" |
| **Secrets Known** | SECRET_1, SECRET_2, SECRET_4, SECRET_9, SECRET_12, SECRET_13, SECRET_15, SECRET_16, SECRET_17, SECRET_18, SECRET_19, SECRET_20 |

**Description:**
The most enigmatic deity - lord of both death AND day. His dual nature (endings and beginnings, darkness and light) makes him philosophically central. He holds 12 forbidden secrets, more arcane knowledge than any other god in the world. His epithet "The Glowing Crypts" suggests he illuminates the underworld, guiding souls with his dawnlantern.

**Corrupted Worshippers:**
- Nebo "The Murky Shade" - strength 54

---

### The Twisted Mother

#### Agwa (Figure #88)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Female |
| **Spheres** | Deformity |

**Description:**
The most disturbing deity - a goddess who embodies physical corruption, mutation, and wrongness of form. She has no epithets, just her stark name. Most troubling: she is the most fervently worshipped god among transformed humans, suggesting her cult may have predisposed followers to accept monstrous transformation.

**Corrupted Worshippers:**
- Slibtu "The Cavernous Abyss" - strength **75** (highest recorded)
- Nebo "The Murky Shade" - strength **94** (highest recorded)
- Mogem "The Sable" - strength 1

**Theological Implication:** Agwa's followers show the strongest faith after transformation. Did worship of deformity prepare them to accept their new forms? Or does she claim monsters as her special children?

---

### The Truth-Speaker

#### Pabat Helpedpeace (Figure #89)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Male |
| **Spheres** | Truth |

**Description:**
God of honesty, oaths kept, and things spoken plainly. His name "Helpedpeace" suggests truth as a path to harmony. Tragically ironic for a civilization plagued by night creatures who steal identities and corrupt from within.

**Corrupted Worshippers:**
- Nebo "The Murky Shade" - strength 58

---

### The Wind-Rider

#### Thab (Figure #90)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Male |
| **Spheres** | Wind |

**Description:**
God of air, breath, and movement. Like Agwa, Thab bears no epithets - a simple, elemental deity. He may represent freedom, travel, or the changing seasons.

**Corrupted Worshippers:**
- Nebo "The Murky Shade" - strength 17

---

### The Dark Patroness

#### Luthi (Figure #91)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Female |
| **Spheres** | Sacrifice, Thralldom |

**Description:**
The most openly dark deity. Luthi demands blood offerings and presides over slavery and servitude. Her presence in the pantheon is disturbing - humans worship a goddess of bondage alongside gods of law and truth. Perhaps she represents the price of civilization, or the darker aspects of religious devotion.

**Corrupted Worshippers:**
- Nebo "The Murky Shade" - strength 43

---

### The Lawgiver

#### Iguk (Figure #92)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Sex** | Male |
| **Spheres** | Laws, Oaths |

**Description:**
God of civilization's foundations - the rules that bind society and the promises that build trust. Iguk represents order against chaos, contracts honored, justice administered. He stands in theological tension with Luthi (thralldom) and Nasnok (revenge).

---

### The Falcon Lord

#### Ulet Greaterveiled "The Squeezing" (Figure #93)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Bird (Peregrine Falcon) |
| **Sex** | Male |
| **Spheres** | War, Chaos, Dreams, Nightmares, Night, Moon, Sky |
| **Epithets** | "Greaterveiled", "The Squeezing" |

**Description:**
The only non-human deity in the pantheon - a falcon god of tremendous power. His seven spheres make him the most influential deity by domain count. He rules war and chaos but also dreams, suggesting he shapes both waking conflict and sleeping visions. "The Squeezing" may reference a falcon's killing grip. As a sky god, he connects to Osman (stars) and Thab (wind).

**Corrupted Worshippers:**
- Nebo "The Murky Shade" - strength 43

|-------|---------------|-------|
| Islas Dawnlantern | SECRET_1, SECRET_2, SECRET_4, SECRET_9, SECRET_12, SECRET_13, SECRET_15, SECRET_16, SECRET_17, SECRET_18, SECRET_19, SECRET_20 | 12 |

Islas holds more forbidden knowledge than any other figure documented. The nature of these secrets is unknown, but their association with a god of death suggests necromantic or eschatological mysteries.

---

## Religious Organizations

No formal religious organizations (temples, priesthoods, or cults) are documented for The Bewildering Nation. Worship appears to be personal or community-based, centered in mead halls rather than dedicated temples.

| Structure | Site | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| The Sculpted Sacrifice | Climaxtails | Mead hall (possible ritual significance given name) |
| The Tiredness Of Taxes | Faithfulflanked (destroyed) | Mead hall |

**Note:** The name "The Sculpted Sacrifice" at the last surviving hamlet suggests Luthi's influence on community gatherings.

## Worship Patterns

### By Deity Popularity

Based on transformed humans' continued worship (a proxy for devotion strength):

| Deity | Monster Worshippers | Max Strength | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| Agwa | 3 | 94 | Most fervently worshipped by monsters |
| Nasnok | 2 | 39 | Revenge goddess attracts killers |
| Islas | 1 | 54 | Keeper of death secrets |
| Pabat | 1 | 58 | Ironic - truth god worshipped by deceivers |
| Luthi | 1 | 43 | Sacrifice goddess |
| Ulet | 1 | 43 | War and nightmare lord |
| Osman | 1 | 13 | Stars |
| Thab | 1 | 17 | Wind |
| Tunem | 1 | 1 | Nearly abandoned |
| Iguk | 0 | - | Law god rejected by monsters |

### Corrupted Worship

Former humans who became night creatures but retain their old faith:

| Monster | Original | Still Worships | Strongest Devotion | Theological Note |
|---------|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Slibtu | Human | Agwa, Nasnok | Agwa (75) | Deformity + Revenge |
| Nebo | Human | 8 deities | Agwa (94) | Kept almost entire faith |
| Mogem | Human | Reg (dwarf god!), Nasnok, Agwa, Osman | Reg (87) | Adopted foreign god |
| Siti | Human | Reg (dwarf god!) | Reg (68) | Completely converted |

**Critical Finding:** Two transformed humans (Mogem, Siti) now primarily worship **Reg** (#44), a dwarf goddess of fortresses, war, and creation. This represents theological corruption across racial lines - monsters abandoning human gods for dwarven ones.

## Theological Themes

### Dominant Motifs

- [x] **Light vs Dark** - Islas (death AND day) embodies this tension directly
- [x] **Order vs Chaos** - Iguk (laws) vs Ulet (chaos) and Luthi (thralldom)
- [x] **Truth vs Deception** - Pabat (truth) in a civilization plagued by night creature impostors
- [ ] **Life vs Death** - Tunem (food) vs Islas (death), but not strongly opposed
- [x] **Body Horror** - Agwa (deformity) as a unique, disturbing sphere

### Theological Tensions

1. **The Pabat Paradox**: A god of truth watches over a people deceived by shapeshifting monsters. Either he is impotent, indifferent, or the monsters' deceptions serve some greater truth.

2. **Luthi's Presence**: Why do a civilized people worship a goddess of sacrifice and slavery alongside gods of law and oaths? Perhaps she represents necessary evils, or debts that must be paid.

3. **Agwa's Children**: The goddess of deformity claims the strongest devotion from transformed humans. Did her worship prepare them to accept monstrous forms, or does she simply embrace what others reject?

4. **The Falcon Outsider**: Ulet is not human - he is a peregrine falcon. Why does a human civilization worship an animal god of war and nightmares? Perhaps he represents the predator humans fear becoming.

### Dark Elements

| Deity | Dark Sphere | Implication |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Agwa | Deformity | Worship of wrongness, mutation, corruption of form |
| Luthi | Sacrifice, Thralldom | Blood offerings, acceptance of slavery |
| Nasnok | Revenge | Sanctified violence, cycles of retribution |
| Ulet | Chaos, Nightmares | Worship of disorder and terror |

Four of ten deities have explicitly dark portfolios. This is not a pantheon of light.

## Comparison to Other Pantheons

| Aspect | Human | Dwarf | Elf |
|--------|-------|-------|-----|
| Deity Count | 10 | 6+ | 1 |
| Faith Type | Polytheistic | Polytheistic | Monotheistic |
| Death Deity | Islas (death + day) | Nar (death only) | None |
| War Deity | Ulet (+ chaos, dreams) | Reg (+ fortresses, creation) | None |
| Dark Spheres | 4 (deformity, sacrifice, revenge, chaos) | 0 documented | 0 |
| Foreign Deity | Ulet (falcon) | None | Famime (unknown race) |
| Secrets Held | 12 (Islas) | Unknown | None |

The human pantheon is the most theologically complex and darkest of the three major civilizations.
