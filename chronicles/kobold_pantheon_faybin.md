# Pantheon of Faybin

> *"We have no gods of our own, so we borrowed yours."*

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Civilization** | Faybin (Entity #28) |
| **Race** | Kobold |
| **Native Deities** | **0** |
| **Adopted Deities** | 16 (from dwarves and humans) |
| **Primary Faith** | Syncretistic Polytheism |
| **Religious Organizations** | None |

### Theological Summary
The kobolds of Faybin possess no gods of their own. Unlike the elves with their nature god Famime, the dwarves with their craft-war pantheon, or the humans with their complex ten-god system, the kobolds developed no divine figures from their own culture. Instead, they adopted the gods of the civilizations they encountered - primarily dwarven deities of earth and death, supplemented by human gods. This borrowed religion reflects the kobolds' position as scavengers and survivors on the margins of civilization, taking what they need from those around them.

## The Adopted Pantheon

### Primary Deities (Dwarf Gods)

The kobolds worship three dwarf gods with near-universal devotion:

#### Onget (Figure #49)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf (male) |
| **Spheres** | Mountains, Volcanos |
| **Worshippers** | 10/10 undead kobolds |
| **Average Strength** | 80+ |

**Description:**
Onget is the most fervently worshipped deity among the kobolds. As a god of mountains and volcanos, he represents the earth's raw power - fitting for a race of cave-dwellers and miners. Nearly every kobold historical figure shows devotion to Onget, with strength values ranging from 73 to 98.

**Notable Worshippers:**
- Pigis (#65) - strength 98 (highest)
- Shrigikilubus (#69) - strength 97
- Loflilis (#68) - strength 95

---

#### Nar (Figure #45)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf (female) |
| **Spheres** | Death |
| **Secrets Known** | 12 secrets (most of any deity) |
| **Worshippers** | 10/10 undead kobolds |
| **Average Strength** | 70+ |

**Description:**
Nar, the dwarf goddess of death, commands universal worship among the kobolds. Given their current existence as undead thralls, this devotion takes on grim irony - they worship the death goddess even after death. Nar holds more secrets than any other deity in the world (12), making her a font of forbidden knowledge.

**Notable Worshippers:**
- Chrikrilbis (#72) - strength 98
- Shaymin (#64) - strength 94
- Brarbis (#66) - strength 91

---

#### Risen (Figure #46)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf (female) |
| **Spheres** | Earth |
| **Worshippers** | 8/10 undead kobolds |
| **Average Strength** | 35 |

**Description:**
Risen governs the earth itself - the stone, the soil, the foundation of the world. For kobolds who lived in caves and excelled at mining and stonecraft, this goddess represents their connection to the underground world. Worship is less intense than for Onget or Nar, but still widespread.

**Notable Worshippers:**
- Pigis (#65) - strength 58
- Gilisreembus (#70) - strength 46
- Chrikrilbis (#72) - strength 39

---

### Secondary Deities (Dwarf Gods)

#### Reg (Figure #44)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf (female) |
| **Spheres** | Fortresses, War, Rebirth, Creation, Pregnancy, Marriage |
| **Worshippers** | 3/10 undead kobolds |

**Description:**
Reg is the most complex dwarf deity, governing both war and creation. Her spheres of rebirth and pregnancy tie her to life's continuation - perhaps relevant to kobolds who have now been reborn through necromancy. Only three kobolds worship her, suggesting she is not central to their faith.

**Worshippers:**
- Tholostaris (#67) - strength 16
- Shrigikilubus (#69) - strength 10

---

### Human Gods Adopted

The kobolds also adopted deities from the human civilization (The Bewildering Nation), though with generally lower devotion:

#### Prominent Human Gods

| Deity | ID | Spheres | Worshippers | Max Strength |
|-------|-----|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Pabat | #89 | Truth | 5 | 19 |
| Islas | #87 | Death, Day | 3 | 22 |
| Ulet | #93 | War, Chaos, Dreams, Night, Moon, Sky | 4 | 20 |
| Iguk | #92 | Laws, Oaths | 3 | 21 |
| Luthi | #91 | Sacrifice, Thralldom | 3 | 20 |
| Tunem | #84 | Food, Agriculture | 4 | 18 |
| Nasnok | #85 | Revenge | 2 | 18 |
| Osman | #86 | Stars | 2 | 5 |
| Agwa | #88 | Deformity | 2 | 13 |
| Thab | #90 | Wind | 0 | - |

**Notes on Human Worship:**
- Worship strength for human gods is consistently lower (5-22) compared to dwarf gods (70-98)
- **Luthi (Sacrifice, Thralldom)** holds disturbing relevance - the kobolds are now literal thralls
- **Islas** shares the death sphere with Nar, suggesting dual death-worship
- **Thab** (Wind) receives no kobold worship - irrelevant to cave-dwellers

## Divine Domains

### By Sphere Category

#### Earth & Stone (Core Faith)
| Deity | Spheres | Origin |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Onget | Mountains, Volcanos | Dwarf |
| Risen | Earth | Dwarf |

*The kobolds' primary worship centers on earth deities - fitting for a race of miners and cave-dwellers.*

#### Death & Darkness
| Deity | Spheres | Origin |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Nar | Death | Dwarf |

#### War & Conflict
| Deity | Spheres | Origin |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Reg | Fortresses, War | Dwarf |

|-------|---------|--------|
| Iguk | Laws, Oaths | Human |
| Pabat | Truth | Human |

*Some kobolds adopted gods of social order - perhaps aspirational.*

|-------|---------|--------|
| Luthi | Sacrifice, Thralldom | Human |
| Agwa | Deformity | Human |
| Nasnok | Revenge | Human |

## Theological Analysis

### Why No Native Gods?

Several theories explain the absence of kobold deities:

1. **Cultural Scavenging**: Kobolds survive by taking from others - this extends to religion
2. **Small Population**: Too few kobolds to develop independent theology
3. **Practical Focus**: Survival-oriented culture left no room for myth-making
4. **Subservient Position**: Always marginal, they deferred to "greater" civilizations' gods

### The Earth-Death Focus

Kobold worship concentrates on:
- **Earth gods** (Onget, Risen) - reflecting their cave-dwelling, mining lifestyle
- **Death god** (Nar) - perhaps recognition of their vulnerability and mortality

This pattern differs sharply from:
- Elves (nature, rivers - surface world)
- Dwarves (craft, war - civilization building)
- Humans (complex pantheon - diverse society)

### Undeath and Worship

The 10 undead kobolds continue their devotion. This raises theological questions:
- Do the death gods (Nar, Islas) claim them as subjects?
- Does worship of Luthi (thralldom) acknowledge their enslaved state?
- Can the undead truly worship, or is this mere habit?

### The Missing Spheres

The kobolds notably lack worship of:
- **Nature** (elven domain)
- **Craft** (dwarven domain - though they are skilled crafters)
- **Family/Home** (despite breeding three families)

## Comparison to Other Pantheons

| Aspect | Kobold | Dwarf | Human | Elf |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-----|
| **Native Gods** | 0 | 6 | 10 | 1 |
| **Adopted Gods** | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Primary Focus** | Earth, Death | Craft, War | Civilization | Nature |
| **Dark Spheres** | Some (borrowed) | None | Many | None |
| **Religious Organization** | None | 3 religions | Multiple | 1 (Druid) |

### Theological Strengths
- Flexibility - can adopt any god that seems useful
- No doctrinal conflicts - borrowed religion has no orthodoxy
- Practical focus - worship what helps survival

### Theological Weaknesses
- No cultural identity through religion
- No divine advocate specifically for kobolds
- Borrowed gods may not favor non-native worshippers
- No religious leadership or structure

## The Roc Confusion

An anomaly appears in kobold worship records: **Figure #0** appears as a "deity" for several kobolds.

| Deity | ID | Actual Identity |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| "Deity #0" | 0 | Litast Greatergorges The Just Fells |

However, Figure #0 is NOT a deity - it is a **Bird Roc** (a giant megabeast) born in Year -35 and killed in Year 153. The kobolds worshipped this creature as a god before its death.

**Worshippers:**
- Pigis (#65) - strength 27
- Gilisreembus (#70) - strength 21
- Chrikrilbis (#72) - strength 21
- Stlabafatrayrbin (#63) - strength 30

**Interpretation:**
The kobolds may have witnessed this giant bird and venerated it as divine. This "worship" of a mortal creature underscores their theological naivety - they couldn't distinguish between gods and powerful beasts.

## Current Religious State

### The Undead and Faith

The 10 undead kobolds retain their pre-death religious affiliations:
- All still "worship" the same gods they did in life
- No evidence of worship change after resurrection
- Their necromancer master (Sodel) worships dwarf gods

### No Living Worshippers Documented

The 105 living kobolds in the general population have no documented worship patterns. They may:
- Continue the same borrowed pantheon
- Have developed new beliefs
- Practice no religion at all

### Future of Kobold Faith

With all historical figures either dead or undead thralls, kobold religion has no leaders, no priests, no organizations. The faith exists only as habit among the undead and mystery among the living.

### Gaps in Knowledge
- [ ] How did kobolds first encounter these deities?
- [ ] Did kobolds have myths about the borrowed gods?
- [ ] What rituals, if any, did they practice?
- [ ] Does the living population worship the same gods?
- [ ] Why was the Roc mistakenly worshipped as a deity?
