# The Unswerving Fells

> *A chronicle of elven endurance in the Plane of Dragons*

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Entity ID** | #30 |
| **Race** | Elf |
| **Type** | Civilization |
| **Founded** | Year 1 (First recorded history) |
| **Status** | **Lost** - All sites abandoned |
| **Population** | 20 elves (homeless survivors) |

### Brief Summary
The Unswerving Fells is the sole elf civilization in Sil Mamgoz. Founded in three forest retreats, it has been completely destroyed over 500 years of devastating losses. All 19 *historical figures* (notable individuals) have perished - the last being Caraca Flutebeaks in Year 36. All three forest retreats now stand abandoned. The 20 surviving elves exist as a scattered, homeless population without leaders, territory, or organized government. Like the dwarves and humans, elven civilization in Sil Måmgoz has been marked as "Lost."

- No defensive fortifications - vulnerable to megabeast attacks

## Religion & Culture

### Pantheon Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Deity Count** | 1 |
| **Primary Faith** | Monotheistic |
| **Deity** | Famime (#73) |
| **Divine Spheres** | Nature, Rivers |

The elves practiced a pure, nature-focused monotheism. Their single deity Famime embodies the natural world - forests, rivers, and the wild. This stands in stark contrast to the humans' ten-god pantheon with its dark spheres of deformity and sacrifice.

*Full pantheon details: [elf_pantheon_the_unswerving_fells.md](elf_pantheon_the_unswerving_fells.md)*

### Worship Strength (from documented figures)

| Figure | Worship Strength | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Sareve Packsoothes | 99 | Highest devotion |
| Fecici Thornwaves | 99 | Equal highest |
| Ova Coalcouple | 99 | Strong even as child |
| Kifino Drilledzephyrs | 98 | Master artisan |
| Caraca Flutebeaks | 98 | Last survivor |
| Irene Tickstaupe | 98 | Animal caretaker |
| Enure Gravelincenses | 97 | Herbalist |

### Cultural Notes
- Forest retreats centered around nature - markets, not mead halls
- Many elves had goals to "see the great natural sites" - pilgrimage culture
- Journey pets were common: leopards, crocodiles, giant cougars, giant ticks
- Master skills: herbalism, bowyer, weaving, woodcraft, clothesmaking, animal care
- Social skills highly valued: conversation, flattery, comedy, negotiation
- Some elves engaged in counterintelligence plots (Rifafa, Sareve, Ova Guildswamps, Kifino)

| Figure | Born | Died | Role | Notable |
|--------|------|------|------|---------|
| Rofa Fancywaxes (#74) | -169 | 32 | Druid | 201 years old at death, led for 31 years |
| Rifafa Creaturebrim (#77) | -143 | 2 | Princess, Ranger | Military tactics, bowyer master |

| Oda Touchmeadows (#134) | -167 | 5 | Bowyer | Musician (stringed instruments) |

### The Children of Shadow

A dark thread runs through elf history: **Vema Toefin (#79)**, listed as "monster of shadow" (Night Creature 3), fathered seven children with elf women before becoming an enemy of his former people.

| Mother | Child | Born | Died | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|------|-------|
| Sareve Packsoothes | Eletha Duskboarded (#120) | 2 | 13 | Killed by night creature |
| Sareve Packsoothes | Ule Silkyobey (#130) | 3 | 32 | Became Acolyte |
| Sareve Packsoothes | Fecici Thornwaves (#145) | 4 | 25 | Tracker, devout (99 strength) |
| Sareve Packsoothes | Caraca Boldsnarling (#162) | 6 | 21 | Killed by night creature |
| Rofa Fancywaxes | Ova Coalcouple (#210) | 13 | 21 | Killed by night creature |
| Rofa Fancywaxes | Thone Jawknow (#212) | 14 | 15 | Killed by titan |

**Theological Note:** Vema Toefin was abducted by the night creature Oce Umbracrypt in Year 13. Was he transformed, or was he always a monster who infiltrated elf society? He remains alive, still worshipping Famime (their nature goddess), and now resides in a lair (site #64) as an enemy of all civilizations.
