# The Bewildering Nation

> *A chronicle of humanity's fragile kingdoms in the Plane of Dragons*

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Entity ID** | #32 |
| **Race** | Human |
| **Type** | Civilization |
| **Founded** | Year 1 (First recorded history) |
| **Status** | **Lost** - All sites abandoned |
| **Capital** | None (castle destroyed) |
| **Population** | 372 humans (homeless survivors) |

### Brief Summary
The Bewildering Nation is the sole human civilization in Sil Måmgoz. Once spanning four settlements including a castle, it has been completely destroyed by monster attacks over five centuries. All sites have been abandoned - even Climaxtails, once thought to be the last holdout, now stands empty. The 372 surviving humans exist as a scattered, homeless population, enduring only through their nomadic Fellowship of Nights and their worship of ten primordial deities. Like the dwarves and elves, humanity in Sil Måmgoz has lost all territorial claims.

- The tomb complex at Wanderedbanner suggests ancestor veneration
- No known written works from human authors survive in records
- Religious practices may include sacrifice (worship of Luthi)

## Historical Figures

### The Fallen (Humans Transformed to Monsters)

The greatest tragedy of The Bewildering Nation is the transformation of its citizens into night creatures:

| Original Name | Monster Name | Transformed | By Whom | Current Status |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Slibtu Trussmoments | "The Cavernous Abyss" | Year 4 | Nawara Tunneledphantom | Alive, 12+ kills |
| Jal Cuddledscrubbed | "The Fatal" | Year 19 | Uno Tombsdied | Died Year 156 |

| Siti Scoopedcolors | (None) | Year 35 | Murkyghost | Alive, master armorer |
| Kor Equaltake | "The Murky" | Year 49 | Uno Tombsdied | Alive |
| Mogem Jestedcandies | "The Sable" | Year 67 | Fere Abyssurn | Alive, former surgeon |

*Note: Fere Abyssurn, who abducted Mogem, is the child of transformed humans Slibtu and Nawara - a second-generation monster born of human blood.*

### Notable Victims

| Figure | Death | Slayer | Location |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Early settlers at Faithfulflanked | Year 2 | Nawara Tunneledphantom | Faithfulflanked |
| Sino Arrowfocus | Year 22 | Slibtu (monster) | Relievedgleamed |
| Multiple defenders | Year 46, 68 | Slibtu | Charcoalsharks |

## Wars & Conflicts

### The Roc Terror (Years 1-153)

**Litast Greatergorges "The Just Fells"** - A male roc with spheres of sky, wind, and hunting - terrorized humanity for over 150 years.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Kills | 41 documented |
| Sites Attacked | 7 times |
| Sites Destroyed | 3 (including 2 human) |
| Reign of Terror | Years 1-153 |
| Death | Killed by an elephant at Climaxtails |

**Human Sites Destroyed by the Roc:**
- Year 38: Relievedgleamed (The Group of Sandals ended)
- Year 92: Faithfulflanked (The East Council ended)

### The Titan's Wrath (Year 91)

**Umbrallilac "The Crystalline"** - A titan 330 years old - destroyed the human castle of Charcoalsharks in Year 91. This ended The Council of Stoking and left humanity without a central seat of power.

### Night Creature Predation

The hamlets of The Bewildering Nation have been hunting grounds for night creatures:

| Site | Abductions | Years |
|------|------------|-------|
| Faithfulflanked | 3+ | 2, 27, 53 |
| Climaxtails | 4+ | 18, 27, 35, 49 |
| Relievedgleamed | 1+ | 22 |
| Charcoalsharks | 1+ | 53 |

### Other Megabeast Attacks
- **Hydra** attacks at various sites
- **Minotaurs** preying on travelers
- **Giant animals** (cougars, lions) hunting near settlements

## Timeline of Major Events

### Year 1 - Foundation
- Relievedgleamed founded (The Group of Sandals established)
- Faithfulflanked founded (The East Council established)
- First roc attack on other settlements begins

### Years 2-10 - The First Abductions
- Year 2: Slibtu abducted from Faithfulflanked
- Year 4: Slibtu transformed into "brute of evil"
- Year 10: Climaxtails founded (The Council of Defenses)

### Years 11-50 - Expansion and Loss
- Year 11: Roc kills settlers at Climaxtails
- Year 19: Jal Cuddledscrubbed abducted and transformed
- Year 22: Slibtu kills at Relievedgleamed (attacking her former home)
- Year 27: Charcoalsharks castle founded (The Council of Stoking)
- Year 27: Nebo Joyoussnarl abducted and transformed
- Year 35: Siti Scoopedcolors transformed

- Year 67: Mogem Jestedcandies abducted (by second-gen monster)

---

## Current State

### Population
- **Total Population:** 372 humans (scattered, homeless)
- **Historical Figures:** Very few named individuals remain
- **Active Settlements:** **NONE** - All sites abandoned
- **Nomadic Survivors:** The Fellowship of Nights (last organized group)

### Active Threats
- [x] Night creature dynasty (Slibtu's bloodline still hunts)
- [x] Second-generation monsters (Fere Abyssurn, Murkyghost)
- [x] Titan Umbrallilac (died Year 95, no longer a threat)
- [x] Various megabeasts and giant animals
- [ ] The Roc (killed Year 153)

### Structural Weaknesses
- **No settlements remain** - all sites abandoned
- No castle or fortified position
- Leadership positions likely vacant or disrupted
- Transformed former citizens actively prey on survivors
- Several monsters retain worship of human gods (theological corruption)

### Prospects
The Bewildering Nation is **extinct as a territorial entity**. Over 500 years of history have reduced four settlements to nothing - even Climaxtails, the last hamlet, now stands empty. The 372 surviving humans exist only as a scattered, homeless population. The transformation of citizens into monsters, particularly the multi-generational night creature dynasties, continues to threaten the survivors. Only the wandering Fellowship of Nights maintains any organized structure. Like the dwarves and elves, humanity in Sil Måmgoz has lost everything.
