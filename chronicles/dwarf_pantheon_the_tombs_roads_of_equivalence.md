# Pantheon of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence

> *"In the deep stone they carved their temples, and in the deep stone their gods dwell still."*

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Civilization** | The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence (Entity #26) |
| **Race** | Dwarf |
| **Number of Deities** | 6 |
| **Primary Faith** | Polytheistic |
| **Religious Organizations** | The Scintillating Fellowship, The Order Of Irons, The Doctrines Of Slaughter |

### Theological Summary
The dwarven pantheon is pragmatic and earth-focused, reflecting the values of a mountain-dwelling people. Three goddesses (Reg, Nar, Risen) and three gods (Idrath, Atir, Onget) govern domains central to dwarven life: fortresses, wealth, jewels, mountains, and the earth itself. Unlike the human pantheon with its dark spheres of deformity and sacrifice, the dwarven gods are concerned with creation, craft, and the natural world beneath the surface. Reg, the goddess of fortresses and war, is the most institutionally prominent deity, with two of three formal religions devoted to her worship.

**Note:** The civilization that worshipped these gods has fallen. The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence was destroyed by civil war (The Crystalline Knights rebellion) between Years 159-501. The 312 surviving dwarves are scattered refugees. Whether these gods still answer prayers or if the temples have fallen silent is unknown.

## The Deities

### The Mother of Fortresses

#### Reg "The Aquamarine Key Of Breaching" (Figure #44)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf |
| **Sex** | Female |
| **Spheres** | Fortresses, War, Rebirth, Creation, Pregnancy, Marriage |
| **Epithets** | "The Aquamarine Key Of Breaching" |
| **Organized Worship** | The Scintillating Fellowship (#46), The Doctrines Of Slaughter (#49) |
| **Worship Strength** | Very High - most institutionally worshipped |

**Description:**
Reg is the supreme deity of dwarven civilization - the goddess who opens mountains for her people (the "key of breaching") and defends them with fortress walls. Her six spheres span the full cycle of dwarven life: she blesses marriages and pregnancies, guides the creation of new works, and promises rebirth after death. In war, she leads her people to victory. Her aquamarine association links her to precious stones deep in the earth.

Two of the three formal religions serve her: The Scintillating Fellowship and The Doctrines Of Slaughter. This dual devotion suggests either different aspects of her worship (creation vs. war) or rival interpretations of her will.

**Notable Worshippers:**
| Figure | Strength | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Udil Minedamuses (#59) | 99 | Maximum devotion - pump operator |
| Ast Testpainted (#50) | 54 | Founding era figure |
| Thikut Morningswords (#62) | 25 | Mechanic |
| Bomrek Focustheater (#1117) | 20 | Current Baron |
| Lokum Glovetwinkles (#53) | 17 | Smelter |

**Cross-Racial Worship:**
Remarkably, two transformed humans now worship Reg as their primary deity:
- Mogem "The Sable" - strength 87 (former human, now night creature)
- Siti Scoopedcolors - strength 68 (former human, now night creature, master armorer)

This suggests Reg's domain over fortresses and creation transcends racial boundaries, or that these monsters seek her protection for their lairs.

### The Death Keeper

#### Nar (Figure #45)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf |
| **Sex** | Female |
| **Spheres** | Death |
| **Epithets** | None |
| **Secrets Known** | SECRET_1, SECRET_2, SECRET_4, SECRET_9, SECRET_12, SECRET_13, SECRET_15, SECRET_16, SECRET_17, SECRET_18, SECRET_19, SECRET_20 |

**Description:**
Nar is the austere goddess of death, bearing only her simple name without epithet. She holds 12 forbidden secrets - more arcane knowledge than any other deity in the world (matching the human death god Islas). These secrets may include necromantic lore, knowledge of the underworld, or truths about what lies beyond mortality.

Despite her stark domain, Nar commands deep devotion among dwarves. Death in the mines, in battle, or from age is a constant companion to the mountain folk, and Nar receives their departed.

**Notable Worshippers:**
| Figure | Strength | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Lokum Glovetwinkles (#53) | 99 | Maximum devotion - smelter |
| Thikut Morningswords (#62) | 63 | Mechanic |
| Ast Testpainted (#50) | - | Founding era figure (no strength recorded) |

---

### The Earth Mother

#### Risen (Figure #46)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf |
| **Sex** | Female |
| **Spheres** | Earth |
| **Epithets** | None |
| **Organized Worship** | The Order Of Irons (#48) |

**Description:**
Risen embodies the earth itself - the stone that shelters dwarves, the soil that covers the surface, the bedrock upon which all is built. Her single sphere encompasses everything the dwarves depend upon: the tunnels they dig, the minerals they mine, the solid ground beneath their feet.

The Order Of Irons is devoted to her worship, suggesting a connection between earth and metalwork - iron comes from the earth Risen governs.

**Notable Worshippers:**
| Figure | Strength | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Thikut Morningswords (#62) | 80 | Mechanic - highest devotion |
| Lokum Glovetwinkles (#53) | 51 | Smelter |
| Ast Testpainted (#50) | 45 | Founding era figure |
| Udil Minedamuses (#59) | 2 | Pump operator |

### The Wealth-Giver

#### Idrath (Figure #47)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf |
| **Sex** | Male |
| **Spheres** | Wealth |
| **Epithets** | None |

**Description:**
Idrath is the god of material prosperity - gold, silver, treasure, and the accumulation of riches. While Atir governs jewels specifically, Idrath encompasses all forms of wealth. He blesses merchants, treasurers, and all who seek fortune in the mountains' depths.

**Notable Worshippers:**
| Figure | Strength | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Kel Gatebreach (#1112) | 74 | Current King - farmer background |
| Stodir Fortressknights (#1114) | 57 | Current Baron |

The fact that both the King and a Baron worship Idrath as their primary deity suggests wealth is central to dwarven governance.

### The Lord of Gems

#### Atir "The Oil Of Diamond" (Figure #48)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf |
| **Sex** | Male |
| **Spheres** | Jewels |
| **Epithets** | "The Oil Of Diamond" |

**Description:**
Atir governs precious gems - diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and all the crystalline treasures of the deep. His epithet "The Oil Of Diamond" may reference the polish and luster that makes gems shine, or the lubricant used in cutting stones. He is the patron of gem cutters, jewelers, and those who appraise precious stones.

**Notable Worshippers:**
| Figure | Strength | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Lokum Glovetwinkles (#53) | 72 | Smelter - highest recorded devotion |

---

### The Mountain Lord

#### Onget (Figure #49)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Dwarf |
| **Sex** | Male |
| **Spheres** | Mountains, Volcanos |
| **Epithets** | None |

**Description:**
Onget is the primal god of the mountains themselves - the peaks that rise above the world and the volcanos that remind dwarves of the earth's fiery heart. His dual spheres represent both the solid and the molten, the cold heights and the burning depths. Dwarves who live in volcanic regions or work with magma forges may particularly revere Onget.

**Notable Worshippers:**
| Figure | Strength | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Lokum Glovetwinkles (#53) | 51 | Smelter |
| Ast Testpainted (#50) | 8 | Founding era figure |
| Thikut Morningswords (#62) | - | Mechanic (no strength recorded) |

| Deity | Secrets Known | Count |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Nar | SECRET_1, SECRET_2, SECRET_4, SECRET_9, SECRET_12, SECRET_13, SECRET_15, SECRET_16, SECRET_17, SECRET_18, SECRET_19, SECRET_20 | 12 |

Nar holds 12 forbidden secrets, tying with the human death god Islas for the most arcane knowledge of any deity. The nature of these secrets remains unknown, but their association with death suggests they concern the nature of mortality, the afterlife, or powers over the dead.

## Religious Organizations

### Formal Religions

| Entity | ID | Deity Served | Notes |
|--------|-----|--------------|-------|
| The Scintillating Fellowship | #46 | Reg (#44) | Likely focuses on creation/rebirth aspects |
| The Order Of Irons | #48 | Risen (#46) | Earth worship, metalworking connection |
| The Doctrines Of Slaughter | #49 | Reg (#44) | Likely focuses on war aspects |

### Theological Note
Two religions serve Reg with very different names: "The Scintillating Fellowship" suggests light, beauty, and perhaps the creative/rebirth aspects of the goddess. "The Doctrines Of Slaughter" emphasizes her war sphere. This may represent a theological schism or simply different communities emphasizing different aspects of worship.

### Temples & Holy Sites

| Structure | Site | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| The Sanctuary Of Larks | Longpaints (#8) | Original fortress temple |
| The Creed Of Splitting | Violentwhipped (#77) | New temple (Year 500) |

## Worship Patterns

### By Deity Popularity

Based on documented worship strength among historical figures:

| Deity | Max Strength | Notable Pattern |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Nar | 99 | Death goddess commands highest devotion |
| Reg | 99 | Equal maximum, most widely worshipped |
| Risen | 80 | Strong devotion |
| Idrath | 74 | Favored by leadership |
| Atir | 72 | Specialist appeal |
| Onget | 51 | Moderate devotion |

### Polytheistic Devotion
Dwarves typically worship multiple deities simultaneously. Sample worship profiles:

**Lokum Glovetwinkles (#53)** - Smelter:
- Nar: 99 (highest)
- Atir: 72
- Risen: 51, Onget: 51
- Reg: 17

**Thikut Morningswords (#62)** - Mechanic:
- Risen: 80 (highest)
- Nar: 63
- Reg: 25
- Plus multiple human gods

### Cross-Racial Worship
Some dwarves also worship gods of other races:

| Dwarf | Foreign Deity | Race | Strength |
|-------|---------------|------|----------|
| Ast Testpainted | Osman (#86) | Human | 11 |
| Thikut Morningswords | Osman (#86) | Human | 15 |
| Thikut Morningswords | Iguk (#92) | Human | 11 |
| Thikut Morningswords | Tunem (#84) | Human | 2 |
| Thikut Morningswords | Ulet (#93) | Human | 1 |
| Lokum Glovetwinkles | Litast (#0) | Roc | 22 |
| Thikut Morningswords | Litast (#0) | Roc | 35 |

**Disturbing Note:** Some dwarves worship Litast (#0), the monstrous roc that terrorized human settlements and destroyed sites. This suggests either fear-based appeasement or admiration for the creature's power over sky and hunting.

## Theological Themes

### Dominant Motifs

- [x] **Earth & Stone** - Risen (earth), Onget (mountains, volcanos), Reg (fortresses)
- [x] **Wealth & Craft** - Idrath (wealth), Atir (jewels), Reg (creation)
- [x] **Life & Death** - Reg (pregnancy, rebirth) vs Nar (death)
- [x] **War & Defense** - Reg (fortresses, war)
- [ ] **Dark Elements** - None documented (unlike human pantheon)

### Theological Balance
The dwarven pantheon is notably balanced:
- Three female deities (Reg, Nar, Risen)
- Three male deities (Idrath, Atir, Onget)
- No explicitly "dark" spheres like the human gods of deformity, sacrifice, or chaos
- Focus on practical, material concerns (stone, wealth, gems, fortresses)

### The Reg Paradox
Reg combines seemingly contradictory domains:
- **War** (destruction, violence) alongside **Creation** (making, building)
- **Death in battle** balanced by **Rebirth**
- **Fortress defense** (isolating) with **Marriage** (unifying)

This suggests dwarven theology sees destruction and creation as part of one cycle - you cannot build without first clearing ground; you cannot defend without being willing to kill.

## Comparison to Other Pantheons

| Aspect | Dwarves | Humans | Elves |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Deity Count | 6 | 10 | 1 |
| Faith Type | Polytheistic | Polytheistic | Monotheistic |
| Death Deity | Nar (death only) | Islas (death + day) | None |
| War Deity | Reg (+ fortresses, creation) | Ulet (+ chaos, dreams) | None |
| Dark Spheres | 0 | 4 (deformity, sacrifice, etc.) | 0 |
| Secrets Held | 12 (Nar) | 12 (Islas) | 0 |
| Formal Religions | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| Earth/Mountain Gods | 2 (Risen, Onget) | 0 | 0 |
| Wealth/Gem Gods | 2 (Idrath, Atir) | 0 | 0 |

The dwarven pantheon is more organized (formal religions) but less theologically dark than the human pantheon, and far more elaborate than the elven monotheism.
