# Pantheon of The Unswerving Fells

> *"One god. One truth. The forest and the river, the leaf and the water - all is Famime."*

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Civilization** | The Unswerving Fells (Entity #30) |
| **Race** | Elf |
| **Number of Deities** | 1 |
| **Primary Faith** | Monotheistic |
| **Religious Organizations** | None documented |

### Theological Summary
The elves practiced pure monotheism, worshipping a single nature deity named Famime. Unlike the humans with their ten gods (including dark patrons of deformity and sacrifice) or the dwarves with their pantheon of craft and war, the elves devoted themselves entirely to a genderless, raceless force of nature and rivers. This simplicity may reflect a more harmonious worldview - or a vulnerability, with no war god to call upon when titans came.

## The Deity

### Famime (Figure #73)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Race** | Unknown (primordial force) |
| **Sex** | Genderless (sex: -1) |
| **Spheres** | Nature, Rivers |
| **Birth** | Before recorded time (-1) |
| **Status** | Immortal |
| **Epithets** | None documented |

**Description:**
Famime is a primordial force rather than an anthropomorphic deity. Without race, gender, or epithets, Famime exists as the pure essence of the natural world. The dual spheres of Nature and Rivers suggest a god of wilderness, forests, flowing water, and the untamed world.

**Theological Position:**
- The ONLY deity worshipped by the elf civilization
- Represents a nature-centric worldview
- No war sphere - elves had no divine patron for battle
- No craft sphere - focus on natural rather than made things
- No death sphere - perhaps elves saw death as simply returning to nature

**Divine Nature:**
The `<force />` tag in the records and unknown race suggest Famime is not a being but a presence - the living spirit of the wild world itself. This aligns with elven culture: forest retreats rather than fortresses, animal companions rather than forged weapons, herbalism rather than metallurgy.

## Worship Patterns

### Devotion Strength by Figure

All documented elves worshipped Famime. Their devotion strength shows remarkable consistency:

| Figure | Worship Strength | Role | Notes |
|--------|------------------|------|-------|
| Sareve Packsoothes (#80) | 99 | Princess | Highest devotion, mother of 4 |
| Fecici Thornwaves (#145) | 99 | Tracker | Equal highest, daughter of Sareve |
| Ova Coalcouple (#210) | 99 | Child | Strong faith even as youth |
| Kifino Drilledzephyrs (#297) | 98 | Princess | Master weaver |
| Caraca Flutebeaks (#81) | 98 | Diplomat | Last surviving elf |
| Irene Tickstaupe (#217) | 98 | Animal Caretaker | Legendary skill |
| Enure Gravelincenses (#78) | 97 | Diplomat | Herbalist |
| Oda Touchmeadows (#134) | 96 | Bowyer | Musician |
| Afe Basinsense (#83) | 95 | Acolyte | Weaver |
| Ula Beastrivers (#239) | 95 | Artisan | Triple master (weaving, wood, cloth) |
| Rofa Fancywaxes (#74) | 93 | Druid | First leader, surprisingly not highest |
| Caraca Boldsnarling (#162) | 91 | Child | Daughter of Sareve |
| Eletha Duskboarded (#120) | 90 | Child | Son of Sareve |
| Ova Guildswamps (#295) | 77 | Princess | Clothesmaker |
| Evala Bandedlions (#75) | 64 | (Night Creature) | Former elf, retained faith |
| Rifafa Creaturebrim (#77) | 59 | Princess | Military leader |
| Pila Blazedbored (#127) | 54 | Appraiser | Lower but present |

**Average Worship Strength:** 88.4

### Worship After Transformation

Two figures continued worshipping Famime after becoming night creatures:

| Monster | Original Race | Worship Strength | Notes |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Vema Toefin (#79) | Unknown | Present | Father of elf children, monster of shadow |
| Evala Bandedlions (#75) | Elf (implied) | 64 | Night Creature 10, former elf member |

**Theological Implication:** Unlike transformed humans who adopt dark gods (Agwa's deformity sphere attracts monsters), transformed elves retain their devotion to pure nature. Even as monsters, they remember the forests and rivers.

## Religious Practice

### Positions and Roles

| Position | Title | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Druid | High priest, spiritual leader |
| 1 | Acolyte | Religious assistant, apprentice |

The Druid served as the primary religious authority. Rofa Fancywaxes held this position from Year 1 until her death in Year 32 - a 31-year tenure as the spiritual heart of elf civilization.

### Inferred Practices

Based on cultural evidence:

- **Nature Pilgrimages**: Many elves had the goal "see the great natural sites" - religious journeys to sacred wilderness
- **Animal Companions**: Journey pets (leopards, crocodiles, giant cougars) may have spiritual significance
- **Herbalism**: High skill levels suggest plant knowledge tied to worship
- **Forest Living**: Choice of forest retreats over fortifications reflects theological values
- **Market Gatherings**: "The Fancy Habit" at Soundedglacier - perhaps for trade of natural goods

### No Dark Elements

The elf religion contains no:
- Sacrifice (unlike human goddess Luthi)
- Thralldom or slavery
- Deformity worship
- Death cults
- Chaos veneration
- Revenge theology

This purity may explain why no transformed elves adopted darker worship - there was no theological path to corruption within their faith.

## Comparison to Other Pantheons

| Aspect | Elf | Human | Dwarf |
|--------|-----|-------|-------|
| **Deity Count** | 1 | 10 | 6+ |
| **Faith Type** | Monotheistic | Polytheistic | Polytheistic |
| **Primary Focus** | Nature, Rivers | Civilization, Duality | Craft, War |
| **Dark Spheres** | 0 | 4 (deformity, sacrifice, revenge, chaos) | 0 documented |
| **War Deity** | None | Ulet (falcon) | Reg (dwarf) |
| **Death Deity** | None | Islas | Nar |
| **Foreign Deity** | None | Ulet (falcon) | None |
| **Secrets Known** | 0 | 12 (Islas) | Unknown |

### Theological Strengths
- Pure, uncorrupted faith
- Strong devotion (average 88.4 strength)
- Harmony with natural world
- No internal religious conflict

### Theological Weaknesses
- No divine patron for war
- No death theology (vulnerable to despair?)
- Single point of failure - if Famime fails, all is lost
- No craft deity to inspire defensive fortifications

## Living Faith

### Current Worship

Though all 19 historical figures died by Year 36, **20 unnamed elves** continue to worship Famime in the forest retreats. The faith persists:

1. **General Population**: 20 elves maintain the worship
2. **Transformed Worshippers**: Vema Toefin and Evala Bandedlions still worship Famime as night creatures
3. **Sacred Sites**: The forest retreats remain active centers of worship
4. **Natural Legacy**: Famime as a force of nature persists regardless of individual worshippers

### Theological Questions

- Who leads religious observances without a Druid?
- Will a new Druid emerge from the 20 survivors?
- As a nature force, does Famime respond to worship at all?
- Do the monster-worshippers corrupt or preserve the faith?

### The Faith Endures

Caraca Flutebeaks, the last *historical figure*, died in Year 36 with devotion strength 98. But she was not the last elf. Twenty others continue in the forest retreats, tending the markets and living in harmony with nature, worshipping the rivers and the trees as their ancestors did.

## Sacred Knowledge

### Secrets of Famime

| Secrets Known | Count |
|---------------|-------|
| None documented | 0 |

Unlike the human god Islas who holds 12 forbidden secrets, Famime appears to have no hidden knowledge. This fits a nature deity - the natural world hides nothing, or perhaps reveals its mysteries only to those who look.
