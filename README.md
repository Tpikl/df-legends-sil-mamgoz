# DF Legends - The Plane of Dragons

A Dwarf Fortress world history project.

## Overview

This repository contains exported legends data from a Dwarf Fortress world (Sil Mamgoz, year 500) and narrative documents derived from that data.

The goal is to break down the raw XML legends exports into readable documents and craft narratives from the historical events, figures, and artifacts contained within.

## Contents

- `world/` - Raw world data and XML legend exports
- `stories/` - Narratives and character studies extracted from the legends

## Source

World generated in Dwarf Fortress with legends exported via DFHack.
