  		<description>The Fuchsia Pregnancy is a form of music used to commemorate important events originating in The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence.  The form guides musicians during improvised performances.  A chanter recites nonsensical words and sounds while the music is played on a leshal and a zilir.  The music is melody and rhythm without harmony.  The melody has phrases of varied length throughout the form.  Never more than an interval sounds at once.  The music repeats for as long as necessary.  It is performed using the izeg scale and in the libash rhythm.  Throughout, when possible, performers are to locally improvise and modulate frequently.  [B]The chanter always provides the rhythm and should be fiery.  The voice uses its entire range.  [B]The leshal always provides the rhythm and should be bright.  [B]The zilir always does the main melody and should feel heroic.  [B]The Fuchsia Pregnancy has a simple structure: three to four lengthy unrelated passages.  [B]Each of the simple passages is moderately fast, and it is to be loud.  Each passage should sometimes include a falling melody pattern with flattened third degree as well as mordents.  [B]Scales are conceived of as two chords built using a division of the perfect fourth interval into eight notes.  The tonic note is a fixed tone passed from teacher to student.  [B]As always, the izeg pentatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords drawn from the fundamental division of the perfect fourth.  These chords are named anam and ustos.  [B]The anam trichord is the 1st, the 5th and the 8th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The ustos trichord is the 1st, the 3rd and the 8th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The libash rhythm is a single line with four beats.  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| - - - x | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  </description>

  		<description>The Satiny Blossom is a form of music used during marches and military engagements originating in The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence.  The rules of the form are applied by composers to produce individual pieces of music which can be performed.  A chanter recites nonsensical words and sounds.  The entire performance is to be in whispered undertones.  The melody has phrases of varied length throughout the form.  Only one pitch is ever played at a time.  It is performed using the gost scale and in the nel rhythm.  Throughout, when possible, composers and performers are to use grace notes, alternate tension and repose and modulate frequently.  [B]The chanter always does the main melody.  [B]The Satiny Blossom has a well-defined multi-passage structure: a lengthy introduction, three to four unrelated passages, a lengthy bridge-passage and a finale.  [B]The introduction should be made with feeling and is at a hurried pace.  The chanter's voice covers its entire range.  [B]Each of the simple passages should feel mournful and is slow.  The chanter's voice stays in the high register.  [B]The bridge-passage should be lively and is very fast.  The chanter's voice ranges from the middle register to the high register.  The passage should be composed and performed using legato.  [B]The finale should be made sweetly and is consistently slowing.  The chanter's voice stays in the middle register.  [B]Scales are conceived of as two chords built using a division of the perfect fourth interval into eight notes.  The tonic note is a fixed tone passed from teacher to student.  [B]As always, the gost hexatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords drawn from the fundamental division of the perfect fourth.  These chords are named anam and zustash.  [B]The anam trichord is the 1st, the 5th and the 8th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The zustash tetrachord is the 1st, the 3rd, the 6th and the 8th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The nel rhythm is made from two patterns: the libash (considered the primary) and the feb.  The patterns are to be played over the same period of time, concluding together regardless of beat number.  [B]The libash rhythm is a single line with four beats.  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| - - - x | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  [B]The feb rhythm is a single line with twenty-nine beats divided into five bars in a 4-5-9-7-4 pattern.

  		<description>The Poet of Silk is a form of music used to commemorate important events originating in The Bewildering Nation.  The rules of the form are applied by composers to produce individual pieces of music which can be performed.  The music is played on three ng�thi, a emat and a i�u.  The musical voices bring melody, counterpoint and rhythm.  The entire performance is to be in whispered undertones.  The melody and counterpoint both have short phrases throughout the form.  The music repeats for as long as necessary.  Throughout, when possible, composers and performers are to modulate frequently.  [B]Each ng�thi always should perform sweetly.  [B]The emat always does the main melody and should feel mysterious.  [B]The i�u always should be melancholic.  [B]The Poet of Silk has a well-defined multi-passage structure: a theme, a bridge-passage and one to two series of variations on the theme.  [B]The theme is voiced by the melody of the ng�thi, the melody of the emat and the melody of the i�u.  The passage is consistently slowing.  The emat covers its entire range from the vibrating low register to the crisp high register and the i�u covers its entire range from the dull low register to the sweet high register.  This passage typically has some sparse chords.  The passage is performed using the agtha scale and in the cish rhythm.  [B]The bridge-passage is voiced by the melody of the emat and the rhythm of the i�u.  The passage moves more quickly than the last passage.  The emat stays in the brittle middle register and the i�u ranges from the dull low register to the flat middle register.  This passage is richly layered with full chords making use of the available range.  The passage is performed using the thad scale and in the arin rhythm.  [B]Each of the series of variations is voiced by the melody of the emat and the counterpoint of the i�u.  Each passage gradually slows as it comes to an end.  The emat ranges from the brittle middle register to the crisp high register and the i�u stays in the dull low register.  This passage is richly layered with full chords making use of the available range.  Each passage is performed without preference for a scale and in free rhythm.  [B]Scales are constructed from twenty-four notes dividing the octave.  In quartertones, their spacing is roughly 1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxO, where 1 is the tonic, O marks the octave and x marks other notes.  The tonic note is a fixed tone passed from teacher to student.  Preferred notes in the fundamental scale are named.  The names are kasmko (spoken ka, 2nd), woge (wo, 3rd), idla (id, 6th), othag (oth, 11th), dik (di, 12th) and tunem (tu, 15th).  [B]The agtha heptatonic scale is constructed by selection of degrees from the fundamental scale.  The degrees selected are the 1st, the 3rd, the 6th, the 10th, the 14th, the 16th and the 19th.  [B]The thad heptatonic scale is constructed by selection of degrees from the fundamental scale.  The degrees selected are the 1st, the 4th, the 8th, the 11th, the 14th, the 15th and the 19th.  [B]The cish rhythm is a single line with sixteen beats divided into four bars in a 4-4-4-4 pattern.  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| x x - - | x - x - | - x x - | - - x x | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  [B]The arin rhythm is made from two patterns: the cish and the nek.  The patterns are to be played over the same period of time, concluding together regardless of beat number.  [B]The nek rhythm is a single line with fourteen beats divided into seven bars in a 2-2-2-2-2-2-2 pattern.  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| x - | - x | x - | x - | - x | - x | x x | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  </description>

  		<description>The Mauve Skirt is a devotional form of music originally devised by the dwarf Mebzuth Oilplains.  The rules of the form are applied by composers to produce individual pieces of music which can be performed.  The music is played on a nubam.  The melody has short phrases throughout the form.  Pitches are densely packed in clusters as music moves from chord to chord.  [B]The nubam always does the main melody, should be delicate and is to become softer and softer.  [B]The Mauve Skirt has the following structure: one to two passages and an additional brief passage possibly all repeated.  [B]Each of the first simple passages is at a hurried pace.  The nubam ranges from the strident middle register to the harsh high register.  Each passage is performed using the kulet scale and in the lakish rhythm.  [B]The second simple passage is consistently slowing.  The nubam is confined to the harsh high register.  The passage is performed using the bem�ng scale and in the biban rhythm.  [B]Scales are conceived of as two chords built using a division of the perfect fourth interval into eight notes.  The tonic note is a fixed tone passed from teacher to student.  [B]As always, the kulet heptatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords drawn from the fundamental division of the perfect fourth.  These chords are named alak and sedil.  [B]The alak tetrachord is the 1st, the 5th, the 6th and the 8th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The sedil tetrachord is the 1st, the 2nd, the 6th and the 8th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]As always, the bem�ng pentatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords drawn from the fundamental division of the perfect fourth.  These chords are named bidok and gatal.  [B]The bidok trichord is the 1st, the 7th and the 8th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The gatal trichord is the 1st, the 5th and the 8th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The lakish rhythm is made from two patterns: the �ntak (considered the primary) and the berim.  The patterns are to be played over the same period of time, concluding together regardless of beat number.  [B]The �ntak rhythm is a single line with three beats.  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| x x x | [B]where x is a beat and | indicates a bar.  [B]The berim rhythm is a single line with sixteen beats divided into eight bars in a 2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2 pattern.  The beats are named ibruk (spoken ib) and ermis (erm).  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| x - | - x | - x | - x | x - | - x | - x | x - | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  [B]The biban rhythm is made from two patterns: the libash (considered the primary) and the thoth.  The patterns are to be played over the same period of time, concluding together regardless of beat number.  [B]The libash rhythm is a single line with four beats.  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| - - - x | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  [B]The thoth rhythm is a single line with eight beats divided into four bars in a 2-2-2-2 pattern.  The beats are named thatthil (spoken tha) and g�stang (g�).  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| - x | - x | x x | x - | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  </description>
