# The Secrets of Life and Death

*A Tale from The Plane of Dragons*

---

## Prologue: The One Who Waits

Long before the dwarves carved their first halls into the mountains, before the elves sang their first songs in the forests, before humans raised their first banners—there was Escu.

**Escu Minecoal the Ivy of Lanterns** emerged into the world in Year -119, a female cyclops born under signs of light and thunder. She embodied six spheres of power: light, lightning, longevity, minerals, strength, and thunder. While the mortal races built their petty kingdoms and squabbled over territory, Escu simply existed—hunting, killing, enduring.

By the time the dwarves of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence founded their civilization, Escu was already over a century old. By the time this tale begins, she had lived for more than two hundred years, and she would live for centuries more. She was not evil in the way mortals understood evil. She was simply hungry, and patient, and eternal.

She became an enemy of every civilization she encountered: The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence, The Orb of Heroes, The Bewildering Nation, The East Council, and many others. To her, they were all the same—soft creatures who built soft homes and carried shiny things worth taking.

In Year 38, a dwarven craftsman named **Adil Ochredived** forged a bronze short sword at the fortress of Longpaints. He named it **Conjurecrows**. The blade was given to **Mistem Coastalcobalt**, a dwarf woman, and it became a symbol of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence.

For seventy-three years, Conjurecrows served the dwarves. Then, in Year 111, Escu came to Chamberland.

She killed Mistem Coastalcobalt and took the sword from her cooling corpse. The cyclops claimed it as an heirloom—her heirloom now, won by right of conquest. In Escu's single eye, there was no irony in this. The strong take from the weak. This was the oldest law, older than dwarves, older than civilization itself.

With Conjurecrows in hand, Escu would go on to slay fifty-seven named figures over the following centuries. The sword forged by dwarves to protect dwarves became the instrument of their destruction.

But that is not this story. This story is about two dwarves who sought to conquer death itself—and what happened when death's older sister came calling.

## Part One: The Slab

In Year 57, a dwarf named **Sodel Severeoils** discovered something that should have remained buried.

Sodel was a wood burner by trade, a devotee of **Onget**, god of mountains and volcanos. He was not a scholar, not a priest, not a seeker of forbidden knowledge. He was simply a dwarf who worked with fire, burning timber to fuel the forges of his people.

The records do not say where he found the artifact, or what compelled him to read it. Perhaps it called to him. Perhaps he stumbled upon it by accident. Perhaps the goddess **Nar**, keeper of death's secrets, guided his hand.

The artifact was a slab of rhyolite called **Cryptfates**. Carved into its surface were words that no mortal was meant to read: *the secrets of life and death*.

Sodel read them. And Sodel was changed.

He did not die. That would have been a mercy. Instead, he learned. He learned how the boundary between life and death could be blurred, bent, broken. He learned how the dead could be made to walk, how flesh could be reshaped, how the natural order could be undone.

And he learned that such knowledge, once gained, could be taught.

## Part Two: The Chain

**Nil Hoodbolts** was born in Year 19 to respectable parents. He grew up in The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence, worshipping the gods of his people: **Risen** of the earth, **Reg** of fortresses and war, and most fervently, **Atir the Oil of Diamond**, god of jewels.

In Year 128, Nil sought out Sodel Severeoils. The records do not say why—whether curiosity, ambition, or something darker drove him. What they do say is that Sodel taught him the secrets of Cryptfates. That same year, Nil settled at a dark tower called **Workboard**, far from the warmth of dwarven hearths.

Six years later, in Year 134, Nil took an apprentice of his own.

**Logem Teethstandards** was seventeen years old when the world began. Born in Year 17 to **Cog Greatesthandles** and **Mafol Thunderbell**, he had lived a full dwarven life before he ever heard of Cryptfates. He had married young—his wife **Astesh Speargilt** was born in Year 13, making her four years his senior. Together they had raised a sprawling family, at least seventeen children who would carry their bloodlines forward.

Logem was devout. He worshipped **Reg the Aquamarine Key of Breaching** above all others, with a faith so strong it measured 96 on the scales used by scholars. He honored **Risen** of the earth, **Onget** of mountains, and even **Nar**, the goddess of death. He had served with distinction in **The Guild of Fealty**, holding a position of authority from Year 110 to Year 133.

He was, by all accounts, a pillar of dwarven society.

And then, in Year 134, he left it all behind.

Logem traveled to Workboard and learned the secrets from Nil Hoodbolts. He settled in the tower, leaving Astesh and their children among the living. The records do not say if he explained his choice to his wife. They do not say if she understood, or if she wept, or if she simply watched him walk away into the darkness.

They only say that he went, and that he stayed.

## Part Three: Etur

**Etur Rawshoots** was born in Year 87, fifty-three years after the founding of her civilization. She grew up in a world already old with history—the great titan **Pado Strappeddune** had been slain decades before her birth, and the wars between elves and humans had settled into an uneasy rhythm of raid and reprisal.

She became a craftsdwarf, specializing in the delicate art of gem encrusting. Her skill was extraordinary—eighteen thousand points of experience, the mark of a true master. She could take rough stone and make it beautiful, adorning fortress walls with patterns of sapphire and ruby that caught the torchlight and threw it back in dancing colors.

She was also gifted with words. She could console the grieving, persuade the doubtful, intimidate the defiant, and make the somber laugh. In another life, she might have been a diplomat, or a counselor, or simply a beloved figure in her community.

Instead, she became something else entirely.

In Year 128, Etur rose to a position of authority within The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. She was forty-one years old, accomplished, respected. She worshipped **Reg the Aquamarine Key of Breaching** with a devotion nearly as strong as Logem's own—a faith strength of 92. She also paid homage to **Litast Greatergorges the Just Fells**, the great Roc who embodied sky and wind and hunting.

She traveled with an elk bird as her companion.

That same year, she married **Adil Stokerceiling**, a dwarf who shared her devotion to Reg.

In Year 129, she gave birth to her first child: **Tekkud Quakeknower**.

Tekkud died in Year 131. He was two years old.

In Year 130, she gave birth to **Catten Galleyplunges**.

Catten died in Year 131. She was one year old.

In Year 132, she gave birth to **Thikut Blowingpaged**.

Thikut died in Year 132. He did not live to see his first birthday.

In Year 134, she gave birth to **Ushat Peltbusts**.

Ushat died in Year 134. Like his brother before him, he did not survive infancy.

Also in Year 134, Adil Stokerceiling died.

The records do not say what killed Etur's children. Disease, perhaps. Accident. The thousand small tragedies that claimed young lives in the deep places of the world. The records do not say what killed her husband, either.

They only say that in five years, Etur Rawshoots buried four children and a spouse.

She was forty-seven years old. She had held positions of power. She had mastered a craft that brought beauty into the world. She had worshipped gods of creation and rebirth.

And she had watched everything she loved die.

## Part Four: The Teaching

Thirteen years passed.

Etur continued to serve The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. She remarried—her second husband was **Lokum Gatebridle**, born in Year 82. She maintained her position of authority. She continued her craft.

But something had changed in her. Perhaps it had changed the moment she laid her first child in the earth. Perhaps it had grown with each small body that followed. Perhaps it had crystallized when she buried Adil, the father of her dead children, and realized that she was alone with her grief and her memories and her unanswered prayers.

The goddess Reg promised rebirth. Where was the rebirth for Tekkud? For Catten? For Thikut? For Ushat?

In Year 147, Etur Rawshoots sought out Logem Teethstandards at the tower of Workboard.

She was sixty years old. She had served her civilization for nineteen years. She had been a faithful worshipper, a master craftsdwarf, a wife, a mother.

She had buried everyone she ever brought into the world.

Logem taught her the secrets of Cryptfates—the secrets of life and death, passed down from Sodel who had read them on a rhyolite slab ninety years before. That same year, Etur settled at Workboard. She ended her position within The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence.

The records note her goal with clinical precision: *to rule the world*.

Perhaps that was true. Or perhaps the scribes who compiled the legends could not understand what truly drove her. Perhaps "rule the world" was simply the closest approximation they could find for a grief so vast it demanded cosmic redress.

She had learned the secrets of life and death. She had learned how to blur the boundary, to bend it, to break it.

Perhaps she only wanted to bring back what she had lost.

---

## Part Five: The Transformation

In Year 153, six years after learning the dark secrets, Etur Rawshoots became ageless.

The forbidden knowledge had done what grief alone could not—it had severed her ties to mortality. She was sixty-six years old when death released its grip on her. She would not age another day. She would not weaken, would not wither, would not fade.

She joined **The Crystalline Knights**, a faction of necromancers based at Workboard. Her master Logem was already a member. So was Nil Hoodbolts, and presumably Sodel Severeoils, the wood burner who had started it all.

The chain of corruption was complete: Sodel to Nil to Logem to Etur. Four dwarves, bound by forbidden knowledge, standing against the natural order of the world.

But Etur was different from her predecessors. Sodel had been a simple laborer who stumbled onto power he never sought. Nil was a scholar who pursued knowledge for its own sake. Logem was a devout dwarf who had somehow reconciled his faith with his damnation.

Etur was a mother who had buried her children.

She did not simply learn the secrets. She *used* them.

---

## Part Six: The War

In Year 158, Astesh Speargilt—Logem's wife, who had remained among the living when her husband walked into darkness—fled to **Chamberland** as a refugee. War was coming. Everyone could feel it.

In Year 159, **The War of Growling** began.

The Crystalline Knights, led by their necromancer lords, declared war on The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. It was not a war of conquest in the traditional sense. It was something worse: a war of kinslaying, of corruption, of the dead against the living.

Etur Rawshoots led armies into battle. The records describe her forces: dwarves of The Crystalline Knights, reanimated humans, animated corpses, and something else—something the records call "HFEXP762."

Historical Figure Experiment 762. Creatures created through Etur's "horrible experiments."

The records note that Etur "performed horrible experiments" at the hamlet of **Climaxtails**. They do not describe these experiments in detail. They do not need to. The results speak for themselves: E_BEASTL3, E_BEAST2, E_HUM1, E_FS4. Experimental beasts. Experimental humans. Experimental... something else.

Sixty-two deaths in the legends are attributed to HFEXP762 creatures. Sixty-two lives ended by Etur's creations.

One of those lives was Astesh Speargilt.

Logem's wife. The woman he had left behind when he walked into darkness. The mother of his seventeen children.

She died at Chamberland in Year 159, struck down by a creature designated E_BEASTL3. The records identify the killer with cold precision: "HFEXP762 E_BEASTL3." A beast created by historical figure 762.

Historical figure 762 was Etur Rawshoots.

The apprentice's creation had killed the master's wife.

The records do not say whether Logem knew. They do not say whether Etur knew. They do not say whether it was intentional, or coincidental, or simply the blind mathematics of war—armies clashing, creatures killing, and one victim among many happening to be connected to one killer among many.

They only say that Astesh died, and that an HFEXP762 creature killed her.

## Part Seven: The Cyclops Returns

Two years after The War of Growling began, in Year 161, Escu Minecoal came to Chamberland.

She was two hundred and eighty years old. She had killed fifty-seven named figures over the course of her long existence. She carried Conjurecrows, the bronze short sword forged by dwarves and taken from dwarven hands fifty years before.

Escu did not care about The War of Growling. She did not care about necromancers or experiments or the secrets of life and death. She cared about hunting, and killing, and taking shiny things from corpses.

Etur Rawshoots had made herself ageless. She had learned secrets that could raise the dead and create abominations. She had become something more than mortal, something that stood outside the natural order.

None of it mattered.

Escu found her at Chamberland—the same site where Etur's creature had killed Astesh two years before. The cyclops struck her down with Conjurecrows. The necromancer fell, and the cyclops took something from her corpse.

Etur Rawshoots was seventy-four years old. She had been ageless for eight years. She had outlived four children, two husbands, and countless others she had sent to early graves. She had learned the secrets of life and death, had created monsters, had waged war against her own people.

In the end, she was killed by a creature older than civilization, a being that cared nothing for her ambitions or her grief or her dark knowledge. To Escu, she was simply prey.

---

## Part Eight: The Master Falls

Logem Teethstandards lived for thirteen more years after his apprentice's death.

The records do not say what he did during those years. Perhaps he continued his work at Workboard. Perhaps he mourned—for Astesh, for Etur, for the world he had helped destroy. Perhaps he simply existed, as the immortal do, watching the centuries creep past while the living aged and died around him.

In Year 174, Escu Minecoal came to **Longpaints**—the dwarven capital fortress, the very place where Conjurecrows had been forged one hundred and thirty-six years before.

She found Logem there.

The cyclops struck him down with the same weapon she had used on Etur. Master and apprentice, killed by the same monster, with the same blade, thirteen years apart.

Logem was one hundred and fifty-seven years old. He had seventeen children, a wife who had died at the hands of his apprentice's creation, and a legacy of darkness that would haunt his civilization for generations.

He had sought the secrets of life and death. In the end, death found him anyway.

## Epilogue: The Chain Unbroken

As of Year 500, when these legends were compiled, The War of Growling has no end date.

The Crystalline Knights still wage their war against The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. The tower of Workboard still stands. The slab Cryptfates still exists, held by some unknown keeper.

Escu Minecoal still lives—six hundred and nineteen years old now, still hunting, still killing, still carrying Conjurecrows. The sword forged by dwarves has killed more dwarves than any enemy blade in history.

Sodel Severeoils, the wood burner who started it all, has no death date in the records. Perhaps he still lives too, somewhere in the dark places of the world, carrying secrets that should have died with him.

And somewhere in the halls of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence, dwarven craftsmen still work their forges, dwarven mothers still birth their children, and dwarven priests still pray to Reg the Aquamarine Key of Breaching for protection and rebirth.

They do not speak of Etur Rawshoots—the master gem encruster, the grieving mother, the necromancer who raised armies of the dead. They do not speak of Logem Teethstandards, or Nil Hoodbolts, or Sodel Severeoils.

But they know the names. Every dwarf knows the names.

And somewhere in the deep places of the world, a rhyolite slab waits in darkness, its surface carved with words that no mortal should ever read.

The secrets of life and death.

The chain remains unbroken.

*Thus ends the tale of Etur Rawshoots and the necromancers of Workboard, as recorded in the legends of Sil Måmgoz, The Plane of Dragons.*
