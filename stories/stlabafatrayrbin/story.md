# The Art of Small Things

*A Tale from Sil Mamgoz, The Plane of Dragons*

---

The dead marched past her in the corridor, and Stlabafatrayrbin counted them as they went.

Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen.

Each corpse moved with the same shuffling gait, arms loose at their sides, eyes fixed on nothing. They had been soldiers once—dwarves who fell defending Longpaints, now raised to serve the army that killed them. Their armor still bore the dents of their final battle. One had lost half its jaw. Another trailed a length of intestine that scraped against the stone floor with each step.

Seventeen. Eighteen.

She pressed herself against the wall to let them pass, though they would have walked around her. The dead followed simple rules. The living followed more complicated ones, and Stlabafatrayrbin had learned all of them in her two hundred and seventy years.

*Make yourself small. Make yourself useful. Make yourself invisible.*

The parade of corpses continued down the corridor toward the main hall, where her master was preparing for the next assault. She did not follow. Her task for the day was already complete—she had arranged the severed hands in the preparation chamber, each one positioned for optimal reanimation. Fingers splayed, palms up, wrists aligned. Forty-three hands from the latest battle. She had sorted them by size and by the calluses on their palms: laborers here, soldiers there, craftsmen in their own row.

The master had not asked her to sort them. He had asked only that they be prepared.

But Stlabafatrayrbin could not help herself. Even in death, there was an order to things. Even in death, there was beauty to be found—if you had the eyes to see it.

## I. The Burrow

Before the tower, before the master, before the dead, there was darkness.

Not the darkness of Workboard's corridors, which was cold and purposeful. The darkness of the kobold warrens was warm, close, alive with the smell of bodies and the sound of breathing. Stlabafatrayrbin had been born into that darkness, and for the first eighteen years of her life, she had believed it was the whole world.

The warrens of Thofolobogus were not grand. They were scratched into the earth with claws and determination, a maze of tunnels barely wide enough for a kobold to pass through. The larger races called them vermin holes. The kobolds called them home.

Stlabafatrayrbin's earliest memory was of her mother's hands—small, quick, clever—weaving a snare from spider silk and sinew. The way the fibers caught the faint light from the surface. The way each loop interlocked with the next, creating something stronger than its parts.

"A trap is a promise," her mother had told her. "You promise the world that something will happen in this exact spot. And if you make the promise right, the world keeps it for you."

She had learned to make her own promises early. By the time she could walk, she was setting snares. By the time she could run, she was checking them. The other kobolds called her odd—she spent too long arranging her traps, adjusting the angle of a trigger, repositioning a weight. They only cared whether the trap caught something. She cared whether it was *right*.

Her mother understood, a little. "You have an eye," she said once. "For the shape of things. Use it."

Stlabafatrayrbin had used it. She became a ranger—one of the few kobolds who ventured to the surface, who learned to track and hunt and hide in the spaces between the larger world. She learned to read the forest floor like a page of text, to see where creatures had passed by the bend of a blade of grass. She learned to dissect the vermin she caught, mapping the architecture of their small bodies with the same attention she gave to her traps.

And somewhere in those years, she learned something else: the larger races were not more intelligent than kobolds. They were simply *bigger*. They filled more space in the world, so the world paid more attention to them. A dwarf could stand in the middle of a road and demand tribute. A kobold could slip past unseen and take what she needed.

Size was not strength. Size was just noise.

The quiet ones—the small ones—could do things the loud ones never imagined.

---

## II. The Breaking

Year 17 began like any other. The snows had melted. The prey was returning. The warrens were alive with preparation for the hunting season.

Then Umbrallilac came.

The titan was a thing of nightmare—vast, ancient, a creature that predated the civilizations that feared it. It did not come to Thofolobogus with purpose or malice. It came because the warrens were there, and it was hungry, and kobolds were small enough to ignore.

Stlabafatrayrbin was on the surface when the screaming started.

She had been checking a trapline near the old oak, the one with the roots that broke through the earth like grasping fingers. She heard the sound first—a rumbling, like thunder that didn't stop. Then she felt it through her feet, through the bones of her legs, a vibration that spoke of something massive moving underground.

Then she heard her people dying.

She did not go back.

This was not cowardice. This was something she had learned in her years as a ranger: when the forest catches fire, you do not run into the flames to save the mice. You find water. You survive. You make new mice later.

But there would be no new mice. The warren was gone. Twenty-seven kobolds died in the attack—she would learn the number later, from records kept by creatures who cared only because they cared about everything. Her mother was among them. Her clutch-siblings. The old trapmaker who had taught her to read the shape of snares.

Gone. Not heroically, not meaningfully. Simply gone, like a footprint washed away by rain.

Stlabafatrayrbin found shelter in an abandoned fox den that night. She curled into the smallest possible shape, made herself invisible to the world, and did not cry. Crying was for creatures who believed someone might hear them.

She stayed in the den for three days. On the third day, she emerged and began to walk.

She did not know where she was going. She only knew she would not return to what remained of her people—the other warrens, the other sitegovernments, the endless scraping existence of kobold-kind. She had seen how easily that life could be erased. A titan's footstep. A moment's hunger. Nothing left but cooling bodies and collapsed tunnels.

She wanted something that would last.

## III. The Wood Burner

She found him by accident—or perhaps he found her.

Forty years had passed since the breaking. Stlabafatrayrbin had survived by doing what kobolds did: staying small, staying quiet, taking what she needed from a world that didn't notice her. She had wandered far from the lands of Faybin, through forests and mountains and the edges of settlements where the larger races lived their larger lives.

She had also listened.

The rangers of any race were gossips, and the edges of civilization were full of rangers. Around campfires she never joined, in taverns she watched through windows, she gathered stories. Stories about a dwarf who had found something terrible. A slab of stone with words that shouldn't be read. A tower rising in the wilderness, where the dead did not stay dead.

Most creatures heard these stories and felt fear.

Stlabafatrayrbin felt something else.

She had spent forty years dissecting things—vermin, prey, the occasional unfortunate bandit who thought a lone kobold was easy prey. She knew how bodies worked. She knew the architecture of life, the way muscles anchored to bones, the way organs nestled together in their cavities. She knew that death was simply the moment when that architecture stopped functioning.

What if it could be made to function again?

What if the promise of a life could be kept, even after it was broken?

She tracked the rumors to their source. It took her three years, moving slowly, carefully, the way a trapper approaches a suspicious burrow. The tower was real. The dwarf was real. And the dead—the dead were real too.

She watched him for seven months before she let him see her.

His name was Sodel Severeoils. He had been a wood burner once, a simple craftsman who fed the forges of his people. Now he was something else. She watched him direct the dead with gestures, watched him speak words that made corpses rise from their slabs, watched him reshape the boundary between life and death like a potter reshaping clay.

And she watched him make mistakes.

His hands were clever, but not precise. His dead walked, but they walked badly—shambling, graceless, more wreckage than restoration. He saw corpses as tools. He did not see them as *art*.

On the day she revealed herself, he was attempting to reanimate a wolf. The creature kept trying to stand on three legs, though it had four. Sodel cursed and pushed it down, beginning the process again.

"The left foreleg," Stlabafatrayrbin said from the doorway. "The tendon is severed at the joint. It cannot bear weight."

The dwarf spun, hammer in hand. She had expected this—the larger races always reached for weapons first. But he did not throw it. His eyes—sharp, calculating—swept over her small form. She saw him register what she was: kobold. Vermin. Harmless.

She also saw him register what she had said.

"You know anatomy," he said. Not a question.

"I know the shape of things."

He lowered the hammer, but did not put it away. "Why are you here, creature?"

"I have been watching you."

"For how long?"

"Seven months."

The silence that followed was heavy. Stlabafatrayrbin did not fill it. She had learned, in her years of survival, that the creature who speaks first often speaks too much.

Finally, Sodel laughed. It was not a pleasant sound. "Seven months. And in seven months, you did not try to steal from me, or spy for my enemies, or sabotage my work."

"No."

"Why not?"

The question was a test. She recognized its shape the way she recognized the shape of a trap. He wanted to know what she wanted. He wanted to judge her intent.

She told him the truth, because lies were a kind of noise, and she preferred silence.

"I want to learn," she said. "What you do with the dead. I want to understand it."

"Why?"

This was the harder question. She took her time with the answer, arranging the words the way she would arrange the components of a snare.

"I have spent my life making small things," she said. "Traps. Snares. Careful arrangements that catch prey and hold it. But all of those things break. All of them fade. The trap catches a rabbit, and then the trap rots. The rabbit feeds a creature, and then the creature dies. Nothing I make lasts."

She met his eyes—something kobolds rarely did with the larger races.

"I want to make something that lasts."

Sodel studied her for a long moment. She felt his attention like a weight, heavy and assessing. Later, she would learn that his skill at judging intent was legendary—he could read a creature's purpose in the set of their shoulders, the rhythm of their breath. What he read in her, she never knew.

What he said was: "You have hands that understand death. I can teach those hands more."

He did not offer friendship. He did not offer partnership. He offered use.

She accepted, because that was enough.

## IV. The Servant

The tower of Workboard rose from the wilderness like a broken finger pointing at the sky. It was not beautiful. It was not meant to be. It was a statement: *I am here, and I do not care if you like it.*

Stlabafatrayrbin understood statements. She also understood that the tower was not for her.

She was given a chamber in the lower levels, near the preparation rooms. It was small—even by kobold standards—and perpetually damp. She did not complain. Complaints were noise.

Instead, she worked.

The first years were menial. She cleaned. She sorted. She prepared bodies for the master's attention, removing armor and clothing, washing away the fluids of death. She dissected specimens he had no time for, mapping their structures in charcoal on scraped hide. She maintained the tools, the tables, the channels that carried blood to the drains.

She also watched.

Sodel taught his secrets to a dwarf named Nil Hoodbolts—a formal apprentice, recognized and named. Stlabafatrayrbin was not invited to those lessons. She attended anyway, from the shadows, from the ventilation shafts, from the small spaces where a kobold could go and a dwarf could not.

She learned.

The secrets of life and death were not what she expected. There was no single incantation, no magic word that made corpses rise. Instead, there was a process—a series of preparations, gestures, and intentions that aligned the dead with the will of the living. It required knowledge of anatomy, of the channels through which life once flowed. It required focus, and patience, and above all, understanding.

The dead were not empty vessels. They were broken machines. Reanimation did not fill them with new life—it convinced the old machinery to function again, in a limited way. The more you understood the machine, the better it would perform.

Sodel understood the machine well enough to make it walk and fight. He did not understand it well enough to make it *whole*.

Stlabafatrayrbin thought she might.

---

Seventeen years passed before Sodel acknowledged her presence in his lessons.

She had been more careless than usual that day, shifting her weight in the ductwork above the preparation chamber. A faint scraping sound. Nil did not notice—he was focused on the corpse before him, trying to make its fingers curl. But Sodel's head turned, just slightly, and his eyes found the shadow where she hid.

He did not speak. He simply returned to the lesson, guiding Nil through the next step of the process.

But that night, he summoned her.

"You have been watching," he said. It was not an accusation.

"Yes."

"For how long?"

"Seventeen years."

The silence stretched. Then: "Show me what you have learned."

He gestured to a table where a human corpse lay—a soldier, judging by the calluses on his hands. Fresh, no more than a day dead. The body was intact except for a deep wound in the chest where a blade had pierced the heart.

Stlabafatrayrbin approached the table. She was so small she had to climb a stool to reach the proper working height. She felt Sodel watching, felt the weight of his judgment, and set it aside. Judgment was noise.

She began.

Her hands moved through the preparations—the positioning of limbs, the clearing of channels, the careful articulation of joints. She did not rush. A trap that was set in haste caught nothing. A body that was prepared carelessly would walk badly, if it walked at all.

When the preparations were complete, she spoke the words. They were not magic—they were instruction, a set of commands delivered in a tone the dead could hear. Rise. Stand. Attend.

The corpse's eyes opened.

It sat up. Turned its head toward her. Waited.

"Stand," she said.

It stood.

The motion was smooth—not the shuffling lurch of Sodel's creations, but something closer to grace. The body moved as it had moved in life, muscles firing in proper sequence, weight shifting naturally from foot to foot.

Stlabafatrayrbin turned to face her master. His expression was unreadable.

"The wound," she said, gesturing to the chest. "I repaired it before reanimation. The path of the blade severed the major nerve cluster that controls the right arm. Without repair, the arm would have hung useless. With repair—"

She gestured again. The corpse raised its right arm, flexed its fingers.

"—it functions."

Sodel was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded, once.

"You will continue your education," he said. "Formally."

It was the closest he would ever come to praise.

---

## V. The Question

The formal education changed nothing.

She was still a servant. She still cleaned and sorted and prepared. She still slept in the damp chamber near the drains. The difference was that now she received direct instruction—not the same instruction Nil received, but instruction nonetheless.

And in the receiving, she began to understand her master.

Sodel Severeoils had read the slab called Cryptfates when he was seventy-two years old. The secrets inscribed there had given him power over death, but they had not given him purpose. He had spent seventy years wondering what to do with his knowledge before deciding to act.

Now he was building an army. The Crystalline Knights, he called them—a name that meant nothing, that was simply a label for the organization of his ambition. He would use the dead to conquer the living. He would bring the dwarven civilization under his control. He would reshape the world according to his will.

It was a grand vision. It was also, Stlabafatrayrbin thought, a small one.

She recognized the shape of his desire. He wanted to be *big*. To take up space. To fill the world with his presence and force it to acknowledge him. It was what all the larger races wanted, in the end—to be seen, to be feared, to be remembered.

Stlabafatrayrbin did not want to be remembered. Memory was noise.

She wanted to make something beautiful.

---

The question came to her one night as she worked alone in the preparation chamber.

She was arranging a set of hands—dwarven hands, laborers' hands, thick-fingered and strong. She had sorted them by size and callus pattern, positioned them in rows that pleased her eye. Each hand was a small miracle of engineering: twenty-seven bones, over thirty muscles, a network of tendons and nerves that allowed for grip and release, for holding and letting go.

In life, these hands had built things. Walls. Tools. Homes.

In death, they could build again—if someone understood how to ask them.

*What would it mean*, she wondered, *to create something that was not just functional but beautiful? A body that moved not just well, but perfectly? A creature that embodied not just power, but grace?*

The thought took root in her mind like a seed in dark soil. It grew slowly, silently, fed by years of observation and practice.

She did not share it with Sodel. She knew, somehow, that he would not understand.

When she asked him once—"Can they be made beautiful?"—he had dismissed the question with a wave of his hand.

"Beauty is irrelevant," he said. "Function is all that matters. A corpse that can hold a sword and swing it is more valuable than a corpse that moves gracefully but cannot fight."

She had nodded and said no more. But in that moment, something shifted between them.

She understood, now, why she did not trust him.

He saw the dead as tools. Instruments of his will. He did not see what she saw: the architecture beneath the flesh, the potential for something greater than mere function. He had been given the secrets of life and death, and he used them to make weapons.

She would use them to make art.

---

## VI. The Waiting

The War of Growling began in the spring of Year 159.

Stlabafatrayrbin had been with Sodel for over a century by then. She had watched The Crystalline Knights grow from a handful of necromancers to an army. She had prepared thousands of bodies for reanimation, sorted tens of thousands of parts, maintained the endless machinery of death that powered her master's ambition.

She had also, quietly, pursued her own work.

In the small hours before dawn, when even the dead seemed to sleep, she experimented. She took the broken pieces that no one else wanted—the partial hands, the shattered limbs, the bodies too damaged for proper use—and she tried to make them whole.

Not just functional. *Whole*.

It was slow work. Most experiments failed. A hand that she spent days repairing would twitch once and go still. A body she had painstakingly reconstructed would rise and immediately collapse, its reintegrated systems rejecting her repairs.

But sometimes, rarely, it worked.

A bird with a broken wing that she had reset and bound flew again. A rat missing a leg walked on four feet instead of three. Small miracles. Small art.

She kept these successes hidden. The master would not understand. He would see them as waste—time and resources spent on creatures that served no purpose in his wars.

But they served a purpose for her. They proved that what she imagined was possible.

*A great work of art.*

The phrase had lodged in her mind years ago, and she had turned it over endlessly, examining it from every angle. What would it look like? What would it be?

She did not know yet. But she was patient. Kobolds were always patient. The small ones had to be.

---

The war raged on.

Sites fell. The dead marched. Stlabafatrayrbin served, as she always had—preparing bodies, sorting parts, maintaining the machinery. She watched the dwarf apprentice Nil grow old and die. She watched Sodel grow more powerful, more distant, more consumed by his ambitions. She watched the armies of the dead swell until they blotted out the horizon.

And she waited.

The master trusted her now, as much as he trusted anyone. He trusted her competence, her precision, her endless utility. He did not know that her trust in him had curdled long ago, had turned to something cold and watchful.

She obeyed. She always obeyed. That was the role she had chosen, the shape she had made herself into. The quiet servant. The useful tool. The kobold in the shadow of the dwarf.

But she had not forgotten her mother's words, spoken in the darkness of a warren that no longer existed:

*A trap is a promise.*

Stlabafatrayrbin was making a promise. She did not yet know when the world would keep it for her.

But she knew, with the patience of a creature who had survived for two and a half centuries, that the moment would come.

---

## VII. The Shape of Things

The dead marched past her in the corridor—fourteen, fifteen, sixteen—and Stlabafatrayrbin counted them as they went.

She had counted so many dead. Thousands. Tens of thousands. Each one a machine that had stopped, been repaired, and set moving again. Each one a small tragedy made useful.

When the procession had passed, she returned to the preparation chamber. Forty-three hands waited for her, arranged in rows that pleased her eye. She would prepare them for reanimation tomorrow. Tonight, she would do something else.

In the corner of the chamber, hidden beneath a loose stone, she kept her real work.

It was a hand—just a hand, nothing more. Dwarf-made, taken from a body too damaged for Sodel's purposes. She had been working on it for three years now, repairing the severed tendons, realigning the shattered bones, rebuilding the network of nerves that once carried sensation from fingertip to brain.

It did not need to be a weapon. It did not need to serve in the wars.

It only needed to be *perfect*.

She lifted it from its hiding place and held it to the light. The fingers were elegant, the proportions exact. The skin had been treated with oils to keep it supple; the joints moved with silent precision. If she raised it now, it would flex and curl and gesture with a grace that no living hand had ever achieved.

It was not yet finished. There was still work to do—refinements to the tendons, adjustments to the bone alignment, improvements to the neural pathways. It would take months more, perhaps years.

But when it was done, it would be beautiful.

And it would be *hers*.

---

Later that night, alone in her chamber, Stlabafatrayrbin dreamed.

She dreamed of the warrens of her youth, the warm darkness and the smell of her mother's fur. She dreamed of traps set perfectly, of promises kept by the world. She dreamed of the titan's footstep and the silence that followed.

And she dreamed of something else—a shape at the edge of her vision, too vast to comprehend. A great work of art, made of death and patience and the small, precise labor of centuries. She could not see its form clearly. She only knew it was there, waiting for her to finish.

*Soon*, she thought. *Not yet, but soon.*

The kobold curled into the smallest possible shape and slept.

Above her, in the tower of Workboard, the master planned his wars.

Below her, in the earth that held the bones of the world, something waited.

And in the dark spaces between—in the shadows where the small ones lived and watched and planned—Stlabafatrayrbin dreamed of art.

---

*Thus continues the tale of Stlabafatrayrbin, kobold ranger, servant of necromancers, and artist of the dead. Her great work remains unfinished. Her master remains ignorant of her true purpose. The wars continue, and the dead march on.*

*But she is patient.*

*She has always been patient.*

*The small ones know how to wait.*

## Author's Note on Crossover with "The Secrets of Life and Death"

This story occurs parallel to the events chronicled in *The Secrets of Life and Death* (Cryptfates). While that tale follows the chain of corruption through the dwarf apprentices—Sodel to Nil to Logem to Etur—this story reveals another thread: the servant who was never truly an apprentice, who learned the same secrets but saw something different in them.

Sodel Severeoils appears in both tales, but from different angles. In Cryptfates, he is the originator of corruption, the dwarf who read the slab and doomed his civilization. Here, he is seen through Stlabafatrayrbin's eyes: a master who mistakes tools for art, power for purpose.

The War of Growling, the tower of Workboard, and the fall of dwarf civilization form the backdrop to both stories. But where Cryptfates tells of grief transformed into destruction, this tale speaks of something smaller and stranger: a kobold's quiet rebellion, expressed not in violence but in the patient pursuit of beauty.

The stories are meant to complement each other. The slab created many monsters. Not all of them wanted the same thing.
