## Core Narrative Arc

### Act I: The Thief (Years -18 to ~Year 1)
A kobold ranger named Stlabafatrayrbin lives among her people in the civilization of Faybin. She excels at trapping, sneaking, and hunting with a crossbow. She dissects vermin. She is small, clever, and invisible in the dark places of the world. Her people are thieves by necessity - the larger races ignore them at best, exterminate them at worst.

### Act II: The Finding (Year ~1 to ~14)
Something changes. She leaves her kobold civilization and its sitegovernment (Thofolobogus). The circumstances are unclear - defection? Exile? Discovery of something forbidden? She encounters Sodel Severeoils, a dwarf wood burner who has learned the secrets of death from the goddess Nar. He sees potential in the small thief. A kobold who can sneak anywhere, trap anything, dissect with precision - what could such hands do with corpses?

### Act III: The Apprenticeship (Year ~14 onwards)
She joins The Crystalline Knights, a dwarf organization led by Sodel. She learns the necromantic secret (SECRET_UNDEAD_RES_17) - the ability to raise the dead. But she is not an apprentice in the formal sense (that position belongs to Nil Hoodbolts, a dwarf). She is something else - a servant who "obeys" but does not trust. Her relationship to Sodel shows trust at -25. Seeds of future conflict.

### Act IV: The War (Year 159 onwards)
The Crystalline Knights launch The War of Growling against dwarven civilization. They also wage The Routed War against humans. Sites fall. The undead march. Stlabafatrayrbin serves in the conquests, but what is her true purpose?

### Act V: The Art (Unresolved)
Her life goal: "create a great work of art." What does a kobold necromancer consider art? An army of the dead? A single perfect resurrection? Something beautiful made from death itself? The story remains unfinished.

## Thematic Elements

### The Unlikely Servant
A kobold in service to dwarves. Her people are vermin to the larger races - thieves, pests, nuisances. Yet here she is, wielding the power of death itself, serving a dwarf master in his wars of conquest.

### The Distrust
She obeys, but her trust is negative. Why does she stay? What does she gain? What is she waiting for?

### The Art
Her goal is not power, not revenge, not wealth - it is to "create a great work of art." For a necromancer, what is art? The question hangs over the entire narrative.

### The War Machine
The Crystalline Knights wage war with undead armies. Stlabafatrayrbin is part of this machine. Her skills - sneaking, trapping, dissecting - have new applications in death.

### The Kobold Tragedy
Her people were massacred by the Titan in Year 17. Many of those killed were former members of her civilization. Did she lose family? Friends? Does she seek revenge through death magic?

## Narrative Questions (Unresolved)

1. **Why did she leave her people?** Defection, exile, or pursuit of forbidden knowledge?
2. **How did she meet Sodel?** Was she recruited, captured, or did she seek him out?
3. **Why does she distrust her master?** What has she seen or learned?
4. **What is her "great work of art"?** The central mystery of her character.
5. **Will she betray Sodel?** The negative trust suggests future conflict.
6. **What is her role in the wars?** Scout, assassin, raiser of the dead?

## Story Perspective Recommendations

**Primary:** 3rd person close, following Stlabafatrayrbin
- Emphasize sensory detail - the smell of caves, the texture of corpses, the weight of secrets
- Her goal of "art" as recurring motif

**Alternative:** Dual perspective
- Chapters alternating between Stlabafatrayrbin (servant) and Sodel (master)
- Dramatic irony as readers see both sides of the distrust

**Tone:** Dark apprenticeship tale with body horror elements
- Think: Gollum meets Victor Frankenstein
- Small creature with vast, terrible ambitions
