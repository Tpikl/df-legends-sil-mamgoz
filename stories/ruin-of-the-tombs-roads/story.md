# The Ruin of the Tombs-Roads

*A Chronicle of Dwarven Destruction*

---

In the world called Sil Mamgoz—The Plane of Dragons—there was only one dwarven civilization.

The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence, they named themselves. They carved their halls into the mountains, raised their fortresses, worshipped their gods of earth and stone and war. For generations they flourished. They built Longpaints, their capital, where the tavern called The Cobalt Baker served ale to craftsmen and soldiers alike. They established Chamberland and Gloveclout, Climaxtails and Ringtubes—settlements spreading across the land like roots through soil.

They were the only dwarves, and they believed they would endure forever.

They were wrong.

This is the chronicle of their ruin—not from invasion, not from plague, not from the dragons that gave their world its name. The dwarves destroyed themselves, and they did it one stone tablet at a time.

## The Slab

In the fifty-seventh year since the founding, a dwarf named Sodel Severeoils found an artifact.

He was a wood burner by trade—a simple craftsman who fed the forges, who turned timber to charcoal for the fires that smelted ore. He was devout, honoring Onget, the god of mountains and volcanos, with the quiet faith of a working dwarf. He had a wife. He would eventually have twelve children. He was, in every way that mattered, unremarkable.

The artifact was a slab of rhyolite stone, pale gray with darker bands, the size of a dwarf's torso. Upon it were carved words in a script that should not have been readable, in a language that should not have existed. The slab was called Cryptfates—in the dwarven tongue, Momuztarem.

The words described the secrets of life and death.

What compels a dwarf to read forbidden knowledge? The histories do not say. Perhaps curiosity. Perhaps ambition. Perhaps the same impulse that drives a moth toward flame—the simple, fatal need to know.

Sodel read the slab.

And Sodel changed.

The transformation was not immediate. He did not grow fangs or claws. He did not sprout wings or scales. He remained, to all appearances, the same wood burner he had always been—a dwarf with skilled hands and a methodical mind, devoted to his god, faithful to his civilization.

But he had learned something that could not be unlearned. He had seen the mechanism behind mortality, the architecture of death, and he had understood how to subvert it. The dead could rise. The ended could continue. The boundary between living and dead was not a wall but a door, and Sodel Severeoils had found the key.

For sixty years, he did nothing with this knowledge.

Then he began to teach.

---

## The Chain

The secret passed from hand to hand like a disease.

In Year 128, Sodel taught a dwarf named Nil Hoodbolts. Nil was younger—born in Year 19—and he had the hunger of youth. He learned quickly. He settled at a tower called Workboard, rising from the wilderness like a broken finger pointing at the sky. The tower would become the seat of their power, the fortress from which the dead would march.

Six years later, in Year 134, Nil taught Logem Teethstandards.

Logem was different. He was a leader—he had held a position of authority in The Guild of Fealty for twenty-three years, from Year 110 to Year 133. He was a patriarch, father to seventeen children, husband to a dwarf woman named Astesh Speargilt. He was devout, more devoted to Reg the Aquamarine Key of Breaching—goddess of fortresses and war, of rebirth and creation—than any dwarf the historians recorded. His faith burned with a strength of ninety-six on the sacred scales.

Why would such a dwarf seek forbidden knowledge? The histories do not say. Perhaps he believed he served his goddess. Reg was, after all, a goddess of rebirth. What greater rebirth than resurrection itself?

Or perhaps the reasoning does not matter. Perhaps the secret simply spreads, finding hosts the way fire finds fuel.

Logem settled at Workboard. His wife Astesh did not accompany him.

The final link in the chain was forged in Year 147, when Logem taught the secret to a dwarf named Etur Rawshoots.

She would prove to be the most terrible of them all.

## The Grief

To understand Etur Rawshoots, you must first understand what she lost.

She was born in Year 87, a craftsdwarf of exceptional talent. Her hands had a gift for gem encrusting—the art of adorning stone with precious jewels, creating beauty from raw materials. Her skill was legendary, measured at eighteen thousand points of proficiency, the highest the scales could record. She could console the grieving, persuade the reluctant, intimidate the resistant. She could make others laugh.

She was devoted to Reg, the same goddess her future master worshipped. She believed in fortresses and war, in rebirth and creation, in the sanctity of marriage. She traveled with an elk bird as her companion, the great creature padding beside her through the halls of her people.

In Year 129, she married a dwarf named Adil Stokerceiling. He shared her devotion to Reg. They believed, perhaps, that their goddess would bless their union.

Their first child, Tekkud Quakeknower, was born that same year.

Tekkud died in Year 131. He was two years old.

Their second child, Catten Galleyplunges, was born in Year 130.

Catten died in Year 131. She was one year old.

Their third child, Thikut Blowingpaged, was born in Year 132.

Thikut died in Year 132. She had not yet seen her first winter.

Their fourth child, Ushat Peltbusts, was born in Year 134.

Ushat died in Year 134. Months old, perhaps weeks.

In the same year, Adil died.

The histories do not record the causes. Disease, perhaps. Accident. The thousand small catastrophes that claim young lives. It does not matter. What matters is this: in five years, Etur Rawshoots buried every child she ever bore and the husband who helped her bear them.

She was forty-seven years old.

For thirteen years after, she continued to live among her people. She remarried—a dwarf named Lokum Gatebridle. She held positions of authority, served in organizations, maintained the appearance of a functioning life.

But something had broken inside her, and it would not be mended.

In Year 147, she sought out Logem Teethstandards and demanded he teach her the secrets of life and death.

She was sixty years old. She had thirteen years of grief festering in her heart. And she had heard whispers of a power that could raise the dead.

Logem taught her.

That same year, she left her position within The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. She settled at Workboard. She joined The Crystalline Knights—the order of necromancers that Sodel had founded.

Six years later, in Year 153, she stopped aging. The secrets she had learned granted her immunity to time itself. She was sixty-six years old, and she would never grow older.

But her children would remain dead. Her first husband would remain dead. The secrets could raise corpses, could animate the fallen, could create armies of the undead—but they could not return the souls of those she had lost.

The histories record her goal with clinical simplicity: "to rule the world."

What they do not record is the rage that drove her. The fury of a mother who had mastered death itself and still could not save her children. The hatred that transforms grief into violence.

Etur Rawshoots did not want to rule the world. She wanted to burn it down.

## The Tower

Workboard rose from the wilderness in coordinates that meant nothing to those who lived and died within its walls.

It was a dark tower, built of stone and purpose, its corridors lit by torchlight that never quite reached the corners. The necromancers gathered there—Sodel at the head, his apprentices beneath him, their own students beneath them. They called themselves The Crystalline Knights, a name that meant nothing, that was simply a label for the organization of their ambition.

Sodel was the boss, had been since Year 117. He held artifacts of power—Greatestglimmer and The Twinkling Venoms—and he commanded the loyalty of dwarves and monsters alike. A kobold named Stlabafatrayrbin served him, a ranger who had learned his secrets and now worked as his hands in the dark places of the world. Other necromancers served beneath him: Ast Testpainted, Nil Hoodbolts, Logem Teethstandards, and eventually Etur Rawshoots.

The tower grew in power. The necromancers refined their arts. The dead began to accumulate—not just dwarven dead, but human corpses, elven bodies, the remains of beasts and monsters. An army was being built, corpse by corpse, in the depths of Workboard.

For decades, they prepared.

In Year 159, they struck.

---

## The War

The War of Growling began in the spring of Year 159.

It was not a war between nations. It was civil war—dwarves against dwarves, the living against those who commanded the dead. The Crystalline Knights, led by Sodel and his necromancers, declared war on The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. The only dwarven civilization in the world turned upon itself.

The attacks came simultaneously at multiple sites.

At Climaxtails, the hamlet with its mead hall called The Sculpted Sacrifice, Etur Rawshoots performed what the historians called "horrible experiments." The nature of these experiments can be inferred from what followed: the dead rose, animated by will not their own, turned against the living they had once called kin.

At Chamberland, the hillocks where refugees had fled the growing conflict, Etur performed the same experiments. Among those refugees was Astesh Speargilt—the wife of Logem Teethstandards, Etur's own master. She had fled to Chamberland seeking safety from the war her husband's order had started.

She did not find safety.

The histories record her death with terrible specificity: she was killed by one of Etur's reanimated beasts. The student had created the monster that killed her master's wife.

Whether Etur knew whose wife she had killed, the histories do not say. Whether she cared, they do not say either.

At Longpaints—the capital, the great fortress, the heart of dwarven civilization—the dead marched against the living. The attack was devastating. Fifteen dwarves fell defending their home in what the historians named The Savage-Assaults of Scorching. The attackers brought armies beyond counting: eighty-two living dwarves who had turned against their people, over a hundred animated human corpses, reanimated elves, beasts, monsters.

Against this tide, the defenders had only their courage and their axes.

Chamberland fell worse. The Ferocious Attack left nine defending dwarves dead, none surviving. An entire settlement, wiped from the world.

But the war did not end with these attacks. The War of Growling had no end date. It continued, year after year, battle after battle, the living and the dead locked in conflict that seemed without resolution.

Etur monitored those she deemed threats—members of The Orb of Heroes, her former allies, whom she planned to "corrupt and pacify." She had become what her goddess represented: fortress and war, transformed from protection into destruction.

And then the cyclops came.

## The One-Eyed

Escu Minecoal the Ivy of Lanterns had lived longer than dwarven civilization.

She was born in Year -119, more than a century before the first dwarven records began. She was a cyclops—a towering creature with a single great eye, massive hands capable of crushing stone, and the patience of mountains. She had no loyalty to any nation, no allegiance to any cause. She was simply a predator, ancient and eternal, and the dwarves were prey.

The histories record her as an enemy of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence, of The Orb of Heroes, of The Bewildering Nation, of The East Council. She did not distinguish between factions. Living or dead, necromancer or defender, they were all meat to her.

She carried an artifact weapon called Conjurecrows—a blade that had tasted dwarven blood for generations. The histories record her kills with meticulous precision: Year 19, two dwarves at Relievedgleamed. Year 27, two more at the same site. Year 41, nine dwarves at Chamberland in a single attack. Year 50, three at Longpaints. Year 81, two at Climaxtails.

On and on the list goes. Sixty dwarves and more, scattered across years and sites, each one a life ended by the same monster with the same weapon.

In Year 41, she killed dwarves at Chamberland named Tekkud Speargilt and Tosid Speargilt—children of Logem Teethstandards, the necromancer who would one day teach Etur the secrets of death. The master lost his children to the monster decades before he learned to raise the dead.

The cosmic irony was complete: the necromancers could raise corpses, but they could not protect the living.

In Year 161, Escu came to Chamberland again.

Etur Rawshoots was there—performing her experiments, commanding her undead, waging her war against the living. She was seventy-four years old and ageless, immune to time, a master of death itself.

The cyclops killed her anyway.

Conjurecrows struck her down—the same weapon that had killed so many before her, that would kill so many after. The necromancer who had sought to rule the world died in the same settlement where her master's wife had died two years before, killed by monsters Etur herself had created.

She had spent her life mastering death, and death took her anyway.

But the killing was not done.

Thirteen years later, in Year 174, Escu Minecoal came to Longpaints—the capital, the great fortress, the heart of what remained of dwarven civilization.

Logem Teethstandards was there.

He was one hundred and fifty-seven years old. He had outlived his wife, killed by his student's creations. He had outlived his student, killed by the cyclops. He had served the necromantic order for forty years, had taught the secrets that led to civil war, had watched his civilization tear itself apart.

Now the cyclops came for him.

Conjurecrows struck him down—the same weapon that had killed his student, the same monster that had killed her. Master and apprentice, both slain by the same creature, with the same blade, at different dwarven sites, thirteen years apart.

The cyclops did not know what she had done. She did not understand the chain of corruption, the secret that had passed from Sodel to Nil to Logem to Etur. She did not understand that she had severed two links in that chain within the span of thirteen years.

She did not care.

She was simply hungry.

---

## The Continuation

The War of Growling has no end.

As of Year 500, when these histories were compiled, the conflict continues. The Crystalline Knights still launch attacks from Workboard. The remaining dwarves of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence still resist. The dead still march against the living.

Sodel Severeoils still lives. He read the slab Cryptfates in Year 57, more than four centuries ago. He taught Nil, who taught Logem, who taught Etur. Nil is dead. Logem is dead. Etur is dead. But Sodel continues, ageless and patient, commanding his order of necromancers from the dark tower.

Escu Minecoal still lives. She was born more than six hundred years ago, and she shows no sign of slowing. She remains an enemy of every nation, a predator who does not distinguish between the factions of a war she does not comprehend.

The slab Cryptfates still exists. It has passed beyond dwarven hands—held now by a giant, far from the civilization it destroyed. The secrets of life and death remain inscribed upon its surface, waiting for the next reader, the next chain of corruption.

The only dwarven civilization in the world continues to destroy itself.

This was not an invasion. This was not a plague. This was a wound that would not heal, inflicted by dwarves upon dwarves, spreading from a single stone tablet to a war without end.

In Year 192, the Crystalline Knights attacked Chamberland again. In Year 234, they struck at Commongutters. The pattern continues, will continue, may continue until the last dwarf falls.

## Epilogue: The Weight of Stone

Consider the slab.

A rhyolite tablet, pale gray with darker bands, inscribed with secrets that should never have been read. It has no will, no intent, no purpose beyond the words carved upon its surface. It simply exists, and it waits.

Consider Sodel, the wood burner who found it. He was unremarkable until he read those words. Then he became something else—not a monster, not yet, but a teacher. He passed the knowledge forward, link by link, until it reached hands that would use it for war.

Consider Etur, the grieving mother who sought power over death because death had taken everything she loved. She buried four children before any of them could walk. She buried a husband in the same year as her last infant. And then she learned that death could be cheated, that corpses could rise, that the ended could continue.

But not her children. Never her children.

Consider the cyclops, older than memory, who killed without understanding. She did not know that the dwarves she slew were necromancers and their apprentices, locked in a war over secrets and power. She did not know that she had killed master and student with the same blade, thirteen years apart. She did not know or care.

She was simply doing what she had always done, since before the dwarves carved their first hall.

Consider the war that has no end. The only dwarven civilization in the world, tearing itself apart over knowledge that should never have been learned, commanded by a dwarf who has lived for five centuries and shows no sign of stopping.

The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence named themselves for permanence. They believed their roads would endure, their tombs would stand, their civilization would continue until the world itself ended.

They were wrong.

A stone tablet. A wood burner's curiosity. A chain of teaching. A mother's grief. A war without end.

This is how a civilization falls. Not with a single blow, but with the slow accumulation of choices—each one reasonable, each one tragic, each one leading to the next until the pattern becomes inevitable.

The slab waits in a giant's hands.

The cyclops waits in her lair.

The war waits for no one.

And the dwarves continue to die, living and dead alike, in a conflict that began with words carved in stone and will not end until there are no more dwarves left to kill.

## Author's Note on Connections

This chronicle exists in the same world as "The Art of Small Things" (the story of Stlabafatrayrbin, the kobold necromancer). Sodel Severeoils appears in both—in this tale as the originator of corruption, in that one as the master who mistakes tools for art. The War of Growling forms the backdrop to both narratives.

Where "The Art of Small Things" examines one servant's quiet rebellion against her master, "The Ruin of the Tombs-Roads" steps back to show the full scope of destruction. The chain of corruption, the civil war, the cyclops who cares nothing for dwarven conflicts—these are the forces that shape both stories.

The two tales are meant to complement each other. One is intimate, following a single kobold's pursuit of beauty in death. The other is epic, charting the fall of a civilization. Together, they show the Plane of Dragons from two angles: the small and the vast, the personal and the historical, the art and the ruin.
