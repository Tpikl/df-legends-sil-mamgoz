# The Ruin of the Tombs-Roads
## A Chronicle of Dwarven Destruction in Sil Mamgoz

**World:** Sil Mamgoz (The Plane of Dragons)
**Subject:** The necromantic corruption that tore apart the only dwarven civilization
**Timeline:** Year 57 to Year 174 (and ongoing)
**Scope:** From a single artifact to civil war to civilizational collapse

---

## Narrative Framework

This is not the story of one necromancer. It is the story of how a single stone tablet destroyed a civilization—passed hand to hand through generations, each holder adding their own tragedy to the chain, until the dwarves of the Tombs-Roads of Equivalence turned upon themselves and never stopped.

**Structure:** Six thematic movements, named for what they represent rather than numbered as "parts"

1. **The Slab** — The artifact Cryptfates and the first corruption
2. **The Chain** — How forbidden knowledge passes through generations
3. **The Grief** — Etur Rawshoots and the making of a monster
4. **The Tower** — Workboard rises, the Crystalline Knights form
5. **The War** — The War of Growling tears the civilization apart
6. **The One-Eyed** — Escu Minecoal, the cyclops who cared nothing for dwarven wars

## Thematic Elements

### The Chain
Knowledge corrupts. Each link in the chain brings their own tragedy, their own reasons for seeking power over death. Sodel: ambition. Nil: uncertain. Logem: devotion (to what?). Etur: grief transformed to rage.

### The Irony
- Etur's undead killed her master's wife
- The cyclops who killed Etur also killed her master, 13 years later
- Master and apprentice, both slain by the same monster with the same weapon
- The monster cared nothing for their war—she was just hungry

### The Scale
This is not about heroes or villains. This is about how a civilization destroys itself. The only dwarven civilization in the world, tearing itself apart while an ancient monster picks off survivors on both sides.

### The Continuation
The war has no end. As of Year 500:
- Sodel still lives
- The Crystalline Knights still attack
- The dwarves still fight
- Nothing has been resolved
- Nothing will be

## Narrative Tone

**Chronicle voice** — Written as if by a historian who knows too much and cares too little. The facts speak for themselves. Four dead children. A wife killed by her husband's student's creations. A cyclops older than civilization.

**Restraint** — Let the tragedy emerge from the facts. Don't overwrite the grief. Etur's four dead children in five years needs no embellishment.

**Scope** — This is not one person's story. This is the story of how the dwarves fell. The characters are vehicles for the larger tragedy.
