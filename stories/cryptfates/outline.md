# Details of Etur Rawshoots

*A Chronicle of Corruption in The Plane of Dragons*

## The Slab of Secrets

In the year 57, a dwarf named **Sodel Severeoils** discovered an artifact that would forever change the fate of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. The artifact was a rhyolite slab called **Cryptfates**, inscribed with *the secrets of life and death*. Sodel, a simple wood burner devoted to the god Onget of mountains and volcanos, read the forbidden knowledge contained within and was forever changed.

The dark knowledge spread like a plague through the generations of dwarves:

- **Year 57**: Sodel Severeoils learns the secrets from Cryptfates
- **Year 128**: Sodel teaches **Nil Hoodbolts**, who settles at the dark tower of Workboard
- **Year 134**: Nil teaches **Logem Teethstandards**, who joins him at Workboard
- **Year 147**: Logem teaches **Etur Rawshoots**, completing the chain of corruption

## Logem Teethstandards: The Master

**Logem Teethstandards** was born in Year 17 to **Cog Greatesthandles** and **Mafol Thunderbell**, respectable dwarves of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. He was a devout worshipper of multiple gods: **Reg the Aquamarine Key of Breaching** (goddess of fortresses and war) held his deepest devotion with a faith strength of 96, but he also honored **Risen** (goddess of earth), **Onget** (god of mountains and volcanos), and even **Nar**, the goddess of death.

Logem married **Astesh Speargilt**, a dwarf woman born in Year 13. Together they had a prolific family, producing at least seventeen children over the course of their long lives. He rose to prominence within **The Guild of Fealty**, serving in a position of authority from Year 110 to Year 133.

But in Year 134, something changed. Logem sought out Nil Hoodbolts and learned SECRET_17—the forbidden knowledge of life and death that originated from the slab Cryptfates. Upon learning these dark secrets, Logem settled at **Workboard**, the sinister tower that would become the seat of The Crystalline Knights.

Logem settled alone at Workboard in Year 134. His wife **Astesh Speargilt** did not accompany him—she remained among the living dwarves of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence. This separation would prove fatal.

In Year 158, as the tensions that would erupt into The War of Growling mounted, Astesh fled to **Chamberland** as a refugee. Then in Year 159, during the war itself, she was struck down—killed by one of Etur Rawshoots' reanimated beasts. The records identify the killer as "HFEXP762 E_BEASTL3"—a creature raised or created by historical figure 762: Etur herself.

Logem's own apprentice had killed his wife.

Logem lived until Year 174, outliving his apprentice Etur by thirteen years. Whether he ever learned that Etur's dark creations were responsible for Astesh's death, the records do not say.

In Year 174, Logem met his end at **Longpaints**—the dwarven capital fortress. He was struck down by **Escu Minecoal the Ivy of Lanterns**, the same ancient cyclops who had killed his apprentice Etur thirteen years earlier. The cyclops wielded an artifact weapon called **Conjurecrows**—the same weapon she had used to slay Etur.

Master and apprentice, both slain by the same monster, with the same weapon.

## Etur Rawshoots: The Apprentice

### Early Life (Year 87-128)

**Etur Rawshoots** was born in Year 87, during what should have been a golden age for the dwarves. She first appeared in the historical record in Year 128, suggesting she lived a quiet life in her early years. She was extraordinarily skilled in **gem encrusting** (18,000 IP)—a master craftsdwarf whose work adorning stone with precious gems was unmatched.

But Etur was more than a craftsdwarf. She possessed considerable social talents:
- **Console** (8,200 IP) - She could comfort the grieving
- **Persuasion** (4,100 IP) - She could convince others to her views
- **Intimidation** (4,100 IP) - She could cow others with fear
- **Comedy** (4,100 IP) - She could make others laugh

She was deeply devoted to **Reg the Aquamarine Key of Breaching**, with a faith strength of 92. She also paid minor homage to **Litast Greatergorges the Just Fells**, the great Roc who embodied sky, wind, and hunting.

She traveled with an **elk bird** as her companion.

### Marriage and Tragedy (Year 129-134)

In Year 129, Etur married **Adil Stokerceiling**, a dwarf born in Year 83 who shared her devotion to Reg. Together they had four children:

1. **Tekkud Quakeknower** - Born 129, died 131 (age 2)
2. **Catten Galleyplunges** - Born 130, died 131 (age 1)
3. **Thikut Blowingpaged** - Born 132, died 132 (less than 1 year)
4. **Ushat Peltbusts** - Born 134, died 134 (less than 1 year)

All four of her children died in infancy or early childhood. The records do not specify the causes, but between Years 129-134, Etur buried every child she bore.

Then, in Year 134, her husband Adil also died.

What transforms a grieving mother, a widow, a master artisan devoted to the goddess of creation and rebirth, into a necromancer who would raise armies of the dead?

Perhaps she sought to bring back what she had lost.

### Rise to Power (Year 128-147)

In Year 128, Etur assumed a position of authority within The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence, serving in an official capacity until Year 147—a remarkable nineteen-year tenure. During this time she was a member of **The Orb of Heroes** (a dwarven site government) and **The Scintillating Fellowship**.

She remarried at some point, wedding **Lokum Gatebridle**, born in Year 82. Lokum would outlive her by only a year, dying in Year 162.

### The Dark Teaching (Year 147)

In Year 147, everything changed. Etur sought out **Logem Teethstandards** and learned SECRET_17—the same forbidden knowledge passed down from the slab Cryptfates. The same year she learned the secret, she settled at **Workboard**, the tower of the necromancers.

The records show she ended her position within The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence that same year. She had made her choice.

Her goal, as recorded in the legends: **to rule the world**.

### The First Ageless Year (Year 153)

In Year 153, Etur became **ageless**—no longer subject to death by old age. The dark arts had granted her unnatural life. She was 66 years old when mortality released its grip on her.

She became a full member of **The Crystalline Knights**, the necromantic order based at Workboard. She also had connections to **The Helmed Boards** and **The Lucky Wires**, related organizations in the growing web of corruption.

### The War of Growling (Year 159)

In Year 159, The Crystalline Knights declared war on their former kin. **The War of Growling** pitted Etur and her fellow necromancers against The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence—her own people.

At the hamlet of **Climaxtails**, Etur **performed horrible experiments**. The nature of these experiments can be inferred from the armies she commanded: reanimated humans, animated elves, undead dwarves. She was raising the dead to fight against the living.

The battles were devastating:
- **The Ferocious Attack** at **Chamberland**: 9 defending dwarves slain, none survived
- **The Savage-Assaults of Scorching** at **Longpaints** (the dwarven capital): 15 dwarves died defending their home

The attackers brought armies of the living and the dead: 82 dwarves, 112 animated human corpses, various beasts and monsters, even reanimated elves. Against this tide, the defenders had only their courage and their axes.

### Intrigue and Paranoia

The records show Etur's state of mind in her final years. She viewed **The Orb of Heroes**—her former allies—as a "possible threat" and planned to "corrupt and pacify" them. She monitored two individuals she deemed threats: historical figures 840 and 960, whom she distrusted deeply (trust: -50 for both).

She had become what she worshipped. Reg the Aquamarine Key was goddess of fortresses and **war**. Etur had built her fortress of the dead and waged her war against the living.

### Death (Year 161)

Etur Rawshoots died in Year 161, at the age of 74. Despite her agelessness, her existence was ended by **Escu Minecoal the Ivy of Lanterns**—a female cyclops born in Year -119 who had terrorized the world for nearly three centuries.

The cyclops struck her down at **Chamberland** with an artifact weapon called **Conjurecrows**—the very same site where Etur's experimental beast had killed Astesh Speargilt two years earlier. Upon defeating Etur, the cyclops stole an item from her corpse.

Escu Minecoal was an enemy of The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence, The Orb of Heroes, The Bewildering Nation, and The East Council. She remains alive as of Year 500, still roaming the world.

Etur had outlived all four of her children, both of her husbands, and countless others she had sent to early graves. In the end, she was not brought down by heroes seeking justice for her crimes, but by a monster older than dwarven civilization itself—a creature that cared nothing for the wars between the living and the dead.

## Legacy

The War of Growling has no end date in the records. As of Year 500, when the legends were compiled, the conflict between The Crystalline Knights and The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence continues.

The tower of **Workboard** still stands. The slab **Cryptfates** still exists, held by historical figure 107. The secrets of life and death continue to corrupt those who seek them.

And somewhere in the depths of The Plane of Dragons, the dwarves still fight—the living against the dead, kin against kin, all because a wood burner once read a stone tablet and learned something no mortal was meant to know.
