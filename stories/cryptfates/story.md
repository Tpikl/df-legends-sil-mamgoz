## Prologue: The One Who Waits

Long before the dwarves carved their first halls into the mountains, before the elves sang their first songs in the forests, before humans raised their first banners—there was Escu.

**Escu Minecoal the Ivy of Lanterns** emerged into the world in Year -119, a female cyclops born under signs of power. She embodied six spheres: light, lightning, longevity, minerals, strength, and thunder. While the mortal races built their petty kingdoms and squabbled over territory, Escu simply existed—hunting, killing, enduring.

By the time the dwarves founded their civilization, Escu was already over a century old. By the time this tale begins, she had lived for more than two hundred years, and she would live for centuries more. She was not evil in the way mortals understood evil. She was simply hungry, and patient, and eternal.

She became an enemy of every civilization she encountered. To her, they were all the same—soft creatures who built soft homes and carried shiny things worth taking.

In Year 38, a dwarven craftsman named **Adil Ochredived** forged a bronze short sword at the fortress of Longpaints. He named it **Conjurecrows**. The blade was given to a dwarf woman named **Mistem Coastalcobalt**, and it became a symbol of the dwarven civilization.

For seventy-three years, Conjurecrows served the dwarves.

Then, in Year 111, Escu came to the hillocks of Chamberland.

She killed Mistem and took the sword from her cooling corpse. The cyclops claimed it as an heirloom—her heirloom now, won by right of conquest. In Escu's single eye, there was no irony in this. The strong take from the weak. This was the oldest law, older than dwarves, older than civilization itself.

With Conjurecrows in hand, Escu would go on to slay fifty-seven named figures over the following centuries. The sword forged by dwarves to protect dwarves became the instrument of their destruction.

But that is not this story. This story is about two dwarves who sought to conquer death itself—and what happened when death's older sister came calling.

---

## Part One: The Slab (Year 57)

In Year 57, a dwarf named **Sodel Severeoils** discovered something that should have remained buried.

Sodel was a wood burner by trade, a devotee of **Onget**, god of mountains and volcanos. He was not a scholar, not a priest, not a seeker of forbidden knowledge. He was simply a dwarf who worked with fire, burning timber to fuel the forges of his people.

The records do not say where he found the artifact, or what compelled him to read it. Perhaps it called to him. Perhaps he stumbled upon it by accident. Perhaps the goddess **Nar**, keeper of death's secrets, guided his hand.

The artifact was a rhyolite slab called **Cryptfates**. Carved into its surface were words that no mortal was meant to read: *the secrets of life and death*.

Sodel read them. And Sodel was changed.

He did not die. That would have been a mercy. Instead, he learned. He learned how the boundary between life and death could be blurred, bent, broken. He learned how the dead could be made to walk, how flesh could be reshaped, how the natural order could be undone.

And he learned that such knowledge, once gained, could be taught.

For seventy years, Sodel carried this burden alone. The records do not say what he did during those decades—whether he practiced his dark arts in secret, whether he resisted the temptation to use what he had learned, or whether he simply waited for the right moment to act.

---

## Part Two: The Tower Rises (Year 127)

In Year 127, Sodel Severeoils built a tower.

He named it **Workboard**—a plain name for a structure that would become the seat of an empire of the dead. The tower rose in the wilderness, far from the warmth of dwarven hearths and the light of dwarven forges.

With its construction came the formation of **The Crystalline Knights**, a new faction under Sodel's leadership. Though it began as a site government—a splinter group, technically still part of the dwarven civilization—it would grow into something far darker.

Sodel settled at Workboard and waited. He had carried his knowledge for seventy years. Now he was ready to share it.

---

## Part Three: The First Apprentice (Year 128)

**Nil Hoodbolts** was born in Year 19 to respectable parents. He grew up among the dwarves, worshipping the gods of his people: **Risen** of the earth, **Reg** of fortresses and war, and most fervently, **Atir the Oil of Diamond**, god of jewels.

In Year 128, Nil sought out Sodel at the tower of Workboard. The records do not say why—whether curiosity, ambition, or something darker drove him. What they do say is that Sodel taught him the secrets of Cryptfates.

Nil Hoodbolts became the first link in a chain that would strangle the dwarven civilization.

---

## Part Four: The Family Man

While Sodel built his tower and Nil learned his secrets, a dwarf named **Logem Teethstandards** was living an entirely different life.

Logem was born in Year 17 to **Cog Greatesthandles** and **Mafol Thunderbell**. He married young—his wife **Astesh Speargilt** was born in Year 13, making her four years his senior. Together they raised a sprawling family of at least seventeen children.

Logem was devout. He worshipped **Reg the Aquamarine Key of Breaching** above all others, the goddess of fortresses and war. He honored **Risen** of the earth, **Onget** of mountains, and even **Nar**, the goddess of death. He served with distinction in **The Guild of Fealty**, holding a position of authority from Year 110 to Year 133.

He was, by all accounts, a pillar of dwarven society.

His children, however, were not so fortunate. One by one, over the course of decades, they fell:

- **Kivish** and **Vutok** died in Year 41
- **Nish** died in Year 46
- **Ezum** died in Year 51
- **Eshtan** and **Monom** died in Year 59
- **Bomrek** died in Year 60

And on it went, child after child, year after year. Some died of violence, others of illness or accident. By the time the war began, Logem had buried every one of his seventeen children. His last child, **Ustuth Archspears**, was killed by a Forgotten Beast at the fortress of Longpaints in Year 156.

Perhaps this endless grief is what drove him to seek out forbidden knowledge.

Perhaps he simply wanted to understand death, having seen so much of it.

---

## Part Five: The Second Apprentice (Year 134)

In Year 134, Logem Teethstandards traveled to the tower of Workboard.

He was 117 years old. He had served his civilization faithfully. He had raised a family, held positions of power, worshipped his gods with devotion. And he had buried children—so many children.

Nil Hoodbolts taught him the secrets of Cryptfates.

When the teaching was complete, Logem settled at Workboard. He did not return to his wife. Astesh Speargilt remained among the living dwarves, in the fortress of Longpaints, while her husband walked into darkness.

The records do not say if he explained his choice to her. They do not say if she understood, or if she wept, or if she simply watched him walk away.

They only say that he went, and that he stayed.

---

## Part Six: Etur

**Etur Rawshoots** was born in Year 87.

She became a craftsdwarf, specializing in gem encrusting—the delicate art of adorning stone with precious gems. Her skill was extraordinary. She could take rough stone and make it beautiful, creating patterns of sapphire and ruby that caught the torchlight and threw it back in dancing colors.

She was also gifted with words. She could console the grieving, persuade the doubtful, intimidate the defiant, and make the somber laugh.

In Year 128, Etur rose to a position of authority within the dwarven civilization. She was forty-one years old, accomplished, respected. She worshipped **Reg the Aquamarine Key of Breaching** with deep devotion.

That same year, she married **Adil Stokerceiling**, a dwarf who shared her faith.

In Year 129, she gave birth to her first child: **Tekkud Quakeknower**.

Tekkud died in Year 131. He was two years old.

In Year 130, she gave birth to **Catten Galleyplunges**.

Catten died in Year 131. She was one year old.

In Year 132, she gave birth to **Thikut Blowingpaged**.

Thikut died in Year 132. He did not live to see his first birthday.

In Year 134, she gave birth to **Ushat Peltbusts**.

Ushat died in Year 134. Like his brother before him, he did not survive infancy.

Also in Year 134, Adil Stokerceiling died.

The records do not say what killed Etur's children. Disease, perhaps. Accident. The thousand small tragedies that claimed young lives in the deep places of the world.

They only say that in five years, Etur buried four children and a spouse.

She remarried at some point—her second husband was **Lokum Gatebridle**. But something had crystallized in her during those years of loss. Perhaps it had changed the moment she laid her first child in the earth. Perhaps it had grown with each small body that followed.

The goddess Reg promised rebirth. Where was the rebirth for Tekkud? For Catten? For Thikut? For Ushat?

---

## Part Seven: The Third Apprentice (Year 147)

In Year 147, Etur Rawshoots sought out Logem Teethstandards at the tower of Workboard.

She was sixty years old. She had served her civilization for nineteen years. She had been a faithful worshipper, a master craftsdwarf, a wife, a mother.

She had buried everyone she ever brought into the world.

Logem taught her the secrets of Cryptfates—the same secrets passed down from Sodel, who had read them on a rhyolite slab ninety years before.

That same year, Etur settled at Workboard. She ended her position within the dwarven civilization and joined The Crystalline Knights.

The records note her goal with clinical precision: *to rule the world*.

Perhaps that was true. Or perhaps the scribes could not understand what truly drove her. Perhaps "rule the world" was simply the closest approximation they could find for a grief so vast it demanded cosmic redress.

---

## Part Eight: The Transformation (Year 153)

In Year 153, six years after learning the dark secrets, Etur Rawshoots became ageless.

The forbidden knowledge had severed her ties to mortality. She was sixty-six years old when death released its grip on her. She would not age another day.

Etur was different from her predecessors. Sodel had been a simple laborer who stumbled onto power he never sought. Nil was a scholar who pursued knowledge for its own sake. Logem was a grieving father who had somehow reconciled his faith with his damnation.

Etur was a mother who had buried her children.

She did not simply learn the secrets. She *used* them.

---

## Part Nine: Suspicion (Year 158)

By Year 158, the tension between The Crystalline Knights and their parent civilization had reached a breaking point. Something was happening at the fortress of Longpaints—something that would shatter Astesh Speargilt's life for the second time.

A murder occurred. The records do not name the victim or the killer, but they note that Astesh was confronted about it. "General suspicion," the scribes wrote. The wife of a necromancer, still living among ordinary dwarves—of course she drew suspicion.

Astesh fled.

She left Longpaints and settled at the hillocks of Chamberland as a refugee. The records note the reason for her flight: she was running from accusations of murder.

Whether she was guilty, the records do not say. Whether she was fleeing her husband's legacy or her own crimes, they do not say.

They only say that she ran, and that running would not save her.

---

## Part Ten: The War (Year 159)

In Year 159, **The War of Growling** began.

The Crystalline Knights declared war on the dwarven civilization—their own parent culture, their own kin. It was not a war of conquest in the traditional sense. It was something worse: a war of kinslaying, of corruption, of the dead against the living.

Etur led armies into battle. The records describe her forces: dwarves of The Crystalline Knights, reanimated humans, animated corpses, and something else—something the records call "HFEXP762."

Historical Figure Experiment 762. Creatures created through Etur's "horrible experiments."

At the hamlet of Climaxtails, Etur "performed horrible experiments." The records do not describe these experiments in detail. They do not need to. The results speak for themselves: experimental beasts, experimental humans, experimental... something else.

Sixty-two deaths in the legends are attributed to HFEXP762 creatures. Sixty-two lives ended by Etur's creations.

One of those lives was Astesh Speargilt.

She died at the hillocks of Chamberland in Year 159, struck down by a creature designated E_BEASTL3—an experimental beast created by Etur Rawshoots.

Logem's wife. The woman he had left behind when he walked into darkness. The mother of his seventeen dead children.

Killed by his apprentice's creation.

The records do not say whether Logem knew. They do not say whether Etur knew whose wife her creature had killed. They do not say whether it was intentional, or coincidental, or simply the blind mathematics of war.

They only say that Astesh died, and that an HFEXP762 creature killed her.

---

## Part Eleven: The Fall of Longpaints (Year 162)

The War of Growling raged on.

In Year 161, Escu Minecoal came to Chamberland—the same hillocks where Astesh had died two years before, the same place where the cyclops had killed Mistem Coastalcobalt fifty years earlier.

She found Etur Rawshoots there.

Etur had made herself ageless. She had learned secrets that could raise the dead and create abominations. She had become something more than mortal.

None of it mattered.

Escu struck her down with Conjurecrows, the bronze short sword forged by dwarves and taken from dwarven hands. The necromancer fell, and the cyclops took something from her corpse.

Etur was seventy-four years old. She had outlived four children, two husbands, and countless others she had sent to early graves. In the end, she was killed by a creature older than civilization—a being that cared nothing for her ambitions or her grief.

One year later, in Year 162, The Crystalline Knights achieved their victory. The fortress of Longpaints fell. Etur's second husband, **Lokum Gatebridle**, died in the assault—struck down by a dwarf, killed by his own kind in the civil war his wife had helped start.

The dwarven capital, the seat of their civilization for over a century and a half, passed into the hands of the necromancers.

---

## Part Twelve: The Master Falls (Year 174)

Logem Teethstandards lived for thirteen more years after his apprentice's death.

The records do not say what he did during those years. Perhaps he continued his work at Workboard. Perhaps he mourned—for Astesh, for Etur, for the children he had buried one by one over the course of a century. Perhaps he simply existed, as the ageless do, watching time creep past.

In Year 174, Escu Minecoal came to Longpaints—the fallen fortress, now held by The Crystalline Knights.

She found Logem there.

The cyclops struck him down with Conjurecrows—the same weapon she had used on Etur thirteen years before. Master and apprentice, killed by the same monster, with the same blade.

Logem was 157 years old. He had seventeen children, all dead. He had a wife who had been killed by his apprentice's creation. He had a legacy of darkness that would outlive him by centuries.

He had sought the secrets of life and death. In the end, death found him anyway.

---

## Epilogue: The Ruin

As of Year 500, when these legends were compiled, the dwarven civilization lies in ruin.

The Crystalline Knights have conquered or destroyed every site that once belonged to their parent culture. Longpaints, Chamberland, Climaxtails—all fallen. The war has no end date in the records because there is no one left to surrender.

And yet, 387 dwarves still live. Scattered, homeless, a population without a homeland—the remnants of a civilization that tore itself apart.

The tower of Workboard still stands, seat of The Crystalline Knights. Escu Minecoal still roams the world at 619 years old, carrying Conjurecrows. The slab Cryptfates still exists somewhere, waiting for the next fool to read its secrets.

Sodel Severeoils, the wood burner who started it all, has no death date in the records. Perhaps he still lives, somewhere in the dark places of the world, the first link in a chain that strangled his own people.

The secrets of life and death endure.

The chain remains unbroken.
