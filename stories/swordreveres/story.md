# Blood on New Stone
## The Founding of Swordreveres

---

They broke ground on the first day of the new century.

Seventeen dwarves—miners and masons, carpenters and stoneworkers, a gem cutter, a clerk, a planter, and one young recruit who had never held a weapon in anger—stood at the foot of a rocky hillside and watched their expedition leader drive the first pick into virgin stone. The sound echoed across the empty valley. Behind them, the wagons still held supplies for a year. Before them lay the work of generations.

They called it Swordreveres. It would honor the blades that had defended their people through five centuries of darkness. The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence had endured much—the corruption of their craftsmen, the rise of the necromancer towers, the endless War of Growling that had torn their civilization in half. But they endured. And now, in Year 500, they would grow again.

The expedition leader was a practical dwarf. She set the miners to their work immediately. The masons began shaping the entrance hall. The carpenter selected timber for scaffolding. Solon Brassspirit, a woodworker of forty-four years, released her rooster and turkey hen from their traveling cage and watched them scratch at the unfamiliar soil.

"They'll lay before the month is out," she told no one in particular. "Good omens."

It was not a good omen.

## The Soldiers of Night

The tower Workboard stood sixty leagues to the northeast. It had been there for nearly four centuries, rising from the earth like a black finger pointing accusation at the sky. Within its walls dwelt the Crystalline Knights—an order that had once been dwarven in all but name, now something else entirely.

Their boss was Sodel Severeoils, five hundred and fifteen years old and counting. He had read the slab Cryptfates in Year 57, when the world was young and necromancy was still a secret. He had taught others. They had taught others. And now the tower's garrison included creatures that walked like dwarves, spoke like dwarves, bore dwarven names—but had not been dwarves for a very long time.

The night's soldiers. That was what the old texts called them. Humanoid forms wrapped in shadow and purpose. They carried axes and spears and crossbows. They remembered skills from lives they no longer lived. And they served the tower.

When word reached Workboard that the Tombs-Roads had founded a new fortress, the response was immediate.

## The Descent

They came on the same day. Before the first sunset.

Twenty-one night's soldiers descended from the northeast, their boots making no sound on the loose stone of the valley floor. They carried steel. They carried malice. They carried orders from a tower that had waged war on its own kind for three hundred and forty-one years.

At their head walked Atir Grizzlylashes, a creature who had been born in Year 240 and had not aged since. His axe was notched from centuries of use. His eyes held nothing that could be called mercy.

Behind him came Urdim Flaxletter, Thikut Boardmerge, Kogan Pagepast. Axemen all. Then the spearmen—Dumed Feedmetals, Urvad Escortvault, others. And at the rear, a single crossbowman: Ineth Catchsilver, who preferred to kill from distance.

They did not march in formation. They did not need to. What formation could civilians possibly muster against them?

## The Warning

Two dwarves saw them coming.

Rimtar Practicedbridged stood at the unfinished wall, her spear loose in her hands. She was forty-one years old, a veteran of the Crystalline Knights—which was the problem. She had come to Swordreveres with the expedition, but her loyalties were... complicated.

Beside her stood Edem Shotravens, a swordswoman of forty-three. Same problem. Same tower. Same divided heart.

"That's Atir," Rimtar said quietly. "And Urdim. The whole first squad."

Edem's hand tightened on her blade. "They're not here for us."

"No. They're here for everyone else."

The two dwarves looked at each other. Behind them, in the half-dug entrance to the fortress, they could hear the miners singing as they worked. Somewhere a rooster crowed. The sound of picks on stone echoed through the valley.

"We could leave," Edem said.

Rimtar shook her head slowly. "Could we?"

A long moment passed. Then both dwarves turned to face the approaching soldiers, weapons raised.

## The Stoneworker

The first to die was Ushrir Gorgerelic.

She was eighteen years old. A stoneworker. She had come to Swordreveres because her parents had come, and her parents had come because the old hillocks were crowded and the new fortress promised land and purpose. She had never held a weapon in her life.

Dumed Feedmetals found her hauling rubble from the dig site. He did not speak. His spear did the speaking for him.

Ushrir fell in the entrance hall that the masons had not yet finished. Her blood was the first to stain the stones of Swordreveres. It would not be the last.

## The Chaos

What followed cannot be called a battle.

The night's soldiers swept into the dig site like water through a broken dam. They found carpenters and killed them. They found miners and killed them. They found a clerk—Besmar Shortrope, twenty-eight years old, who had come to keep records of the expedition's supplies—and they cut him down where he stood.

Besmar did not die quickly. He crawled behind a pile of stone blocks, clutching his wounds, and bled for nearly three hours before his heart finally stopped.

In the chaos, something strange happened.

Rimtar Practicedbridged killed Erib Veiledtrades, a carpenter of fifty-four years.

Edem Shotravens killed Avuz Bridgerag, a miner of forty-one.

Rimtar killed Uzol Sunkbust, another miner.

These were not enemies. These were their own people. The records do not explain why. Perhaps the civilians panicked and were mistaken for attackers in the confusion. Perhaps Rimtar and Edem were trying to stop them from running into greater danger. Perhaps something darker—old loyalties asserting themselves, the tower's conditioning breaking through.

We will never know. The dead cannot speak, and the killers left no testimony.

## The Rooster and the Hen

Atir Grizzlylashes was efficient.

He found the gem cutter Unib Craftlulls hiding behind a cart and opened him from collar to hip. He found the mason Ablel Sunktongs trying to barricade a doorway that did not yet have a door and struck her down with a single blow. He found the woodworker Solon Brassspirit running toward the southern passage.

He killed her pets first.

Goden Ripemountains—the rooster—died at 150939 seconds after midnight. Monom Ringspirals—the turkey hen—had died forty-six seconds earlier. Solon saw them fall. She saw Atir turn toward her, his axe dripping with blood and feathers.

She did not run. Perhaps she could not. Perhaps she simply understood there was nowhere to go.

The records say she died of blood loss, eight minutes later. That means Atir wounded her but did not finish her. That means she lay in the dirt, watching her blood seep into the new stone of Swordreveres, waiting for the end.

## The Recruit

Feb Saintboots was nineteen years old.

He was the only trained soldier among the civilians—if you could call a few months of militia training "trained." He carried a weapon. He knew which end was sharp. When the screaming started, he ran toward it instead of away.

Ineth Catchsilver shot him from eighty paces.

The crossbow bolt took him in the chest. He fell in the half-dug entrance hall, next to the stoneworker who had died three hours earlier, and he did not get up again.

He never swung his weapon. He never reached the enemy. He was a boy who wanted to be a soldier, and he died before he had the chance.

## The Aftermath

By the time the night's soldiers withdrew, eleven dwarves and two birds lay dead in the halls of Swordreveres.

Rimtar Practicedbridged and Edem Shotravens survived. The records show they killed three people each—some enemies, some not. They still listed Workboard as their home. They did not leave with the retreating soldiers. They did not explain themselves.

The remaining survivors—six dwarves, shaken and bloodied—gathered in the unfinished main hall as the sun set on the first day of their fortress's existence. Around them, the blood was already drying on the new stone. The tools still lay where the miners had dropped them. The scaffolding stood half-built, waiting for carpenters who would never return.

Swordreveres had been founded that morning. By evening, it had lost more than half its population.

## The War Continues

This was not unique. This was not special. This was simply what the War of Growling looked like, three hundred and forty-one years after it began.

The war had started in Year 159, when a grief-maddened necromancer named Etur Rawshoots—who had lost four children in five years, who had learned the secrets of death from a stone tablet, who had sworn to rule the world—raised an army of the dead and marched on her own people.

Etur died in Year 161, killed by a cyclops who cared nothing for dwarven wars. But the war did not end. Wars never end that easily. The Crystalline Knights continued. The tower Workboard still stood. The night's soldiers still marched.

Sodel Severeoils, who had started it all by reading a forbidden slab in Year 57, was still alive. Still giving orders. Still sending his soldiers to kill dwarves who had done nothing wrong except try to build something new.

And so the dwarves of Swordreveres—the survivors—picked up their tools. They returned to the dig. They buried their dead in the stone that was meant to be their foundation.

They had come to build a fortress. They would build it still. Because that was what dwarves did. They endured. They built. They remembered.

And the war continued.

*Year 500 of the world. First day. Swordreveres founded. Swordreveres baptized in blood. The work goes on.*
