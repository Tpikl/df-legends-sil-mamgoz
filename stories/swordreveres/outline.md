# The Founding of Swordreveres
## Blood on New Stone

**World:** Sil Mamgoz (The Plane of Dragons)
**Subject:** The founding of a dwarven fortress and its baptism in blood
**Timeline:** Year 500
**Scope:** One day. One battle. Thirteen deaths.

---

## Narrative Framework

In the 500th year of the world, the dwarves of the Tombs-Roads of Equivalence struck out to found a new fortress. They called it Swordreveres. Before the first season turned, the tower came for them.

This is not the story of a siege. It is the story of what happens when civilians meet soldiers—when miners and carpenters and stoneworkers face axemen and crossbowmen who wear the faces of the dead.

**Structure:** Three movements

1. **The Founding** — Swordreveres is established by The Gloved Dyes
2. **The Raid** — The night's soldiers descend from Workboard
3. **The Reckoning** — Who lived, who died, and what it means

## The Attackers: Night's Soldiers

The HFEXP762 E_HUM1 race is called "night's soldiers" in the creature raw data. These are cursed or created beings—humanoid in form but otherworldly in nature. They have dwarven-style names, suggesting they were once dwarves themselves, or were created by dwarven necromancy.

All serve The Crystalline Knights at tower Workboard.

### Named Attackers (Year 500 Battle)

| Name | ID | Type | Birth Year | Kills at Swordreveres |
|------|-----|------|------------|----------------------|
| Atir Grizzlylashes | 1093 | Axeman | 240 | 3 (Ablel, Solon, Goden the chicken) |
| Urdim Flaxletter | 1091 | Axeman | 262 | 2 (Besmar, Bomrek) |
| Thikut Boardmerge | 1087 | Axeman | 328 | 1 (Unib) |
| Kogan Pagepast | 1089 | Axeman | 227 | 1 (Monom the turkey) |
| Dumed Feedmetals | 1098 | Spearman | 262 | 1 (Ushrir) |
| Udib Rhymedbridge | 1105 | Maceman | 304 | 1 (Urdim Painthelped) |
| Ineth Catchsilver | 1106 | Crossbowman | 268 | 1 (Feb, shot with bolt) |

**Notable:** These night's soldiers are 170-270+ years old, yet bear the memories and skills of living beings. Atir Grizzlylashes—260 years old—killed three in rapid succession with weapon item 2206.

## The Defenders

### The Fallen

| Name | ID | Profession | Born | Age at Death | Killed By | Cause |
|------|-----|-----------|------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Ushrir Gorgerelic | 1079 | Stoneworker | 482 | 18 | Dumed Feedmetals | Struck |
| Erib Veiledtrades | 1075 | Carpenter | 446 | 54 | Rimtar Practicedbridged* | Struck |
| Avuz Bridgerag | 1073 | Miner | 459 | 41 | Edem Shotravens* | Struck |
| Uzol Sunkbust | 1072 | Miner | 451 | 49 | Rimtar Practicedbridged* | Struck |
| Besmar Shortrope | 1071 | Clerk | 472 | 28 | Urdim Flaxletter | Blood loss |
| Urdim Painthelped | 1077 | Miner | 446 | 54 | Udib Rhymedbridge | Struck |
| Solon Brassspirit | 1080 | Woodworker | 456 | 44 | Atir Grizzlylashes | Blood loss |
| Unib Craftlulls | 1083 | Gem Cutter | 464 | 36 | Thikut Boardmerge | Struck |
| Ablel Sunktongs | 1084 | Mason | 442 | 58 | Atir Grizzlylashes | Struck |
| Bomrek Tomeroot | 1076 | Planter | 452 | 48 | Urdim Flaxletter | Struck |
| Feb Saintboots | 1074 | Recruit | 481 | 19 | Ineth Catchsilver | Shot |

*Note: These deaths were by dwarven defenders killing civilians caught in crossfire or chaos—a tragic detail.

### The Pets

| Name | ID | Species | Owner | Killed By |
|------|-----|---------|-------|-----------|
| Goden Ripemountains | 1081 | Rooster | Solon Brassspirit | Atir Grizzlylashes |
| Monom Ringspirals | 1082 | Turkey hen | Solon Brassspirit | Kogan Pagepast |

Solon lost both her pets moments before her own death.

### The Survivors Who Fought Back

| Name | ID | Type | Born | Deity | Kills |
|------|-----|------|------|-------|-------|
| Rimtar Practicedbridged | 1103 | Spearwoman | 459 | Nar (death goddess) | 2 |
| Edem Shotravens | 1104 | Swordswoman | 457 | Risen (deity 91) | 1 |

**The Irony:** Rimtar and Edem, the two dwarves who killed enemies in the battle, are members of The Crystalline Knights themselves—the same organization that sent the night's soldiers. They appear to have defected to defend Swordreveres, or were stationed there as part of some arrangement.

Both warriors have "home site building" listed at tower Workboard (site 20), yet they appeared at Swordreveres (site 76) and killed attackers from their own faction.

## Thematic Elements

### The New and the Old
Swordreveres is a new fortress—founded on the first day of Year 500, the start of a new century in the world's history. But the war that came for it is old. The War of Growling began in Year 159. By Year 500, it has raged for 341 years.

### Civilians vs. Soldiers
Every defender who died was a civilian: miners, carpenters, masons, a gem cutter, a clerk, a planter. The only trained recruit—Feb Saintboots, age 19—was shot down by a crossbow bolt before he could fight.

The attackers were professional soldiers. Axemen with 3000+ skill points. A crossbowman who could hit a target from distance. Veterans of a war older than most of their victims.

### The Pets
Solon Brassspirit brought her rooster and her turkey hen to the new fortress. Perhaps she thought she was starting fresh. The night's soldiers killed both animals within seconds of each other, moments before killing Solon herself.

### The Knight-Defenders
The greatest mystery: Rimtar Practicedbridged and Edem Shotravens, members of The Crystalline Knights, fighting against the tower's own soldiers. Are they defectors? Spies whose cover was blown? Dwarves torn between loyalty to their civilization and to their tower?

Both survived the battle. Both still list Workboard as their home.

## Connection to Larger Narrative

This battle is a single skirmish in the War of Growling (Year 159—ongoing). The war was started by Etur Rawshoots, a grief-maddened necromancer who learned her craft from the slab Cryptfates and vowed to rule the world.

Etur died in Year 161, killed by the cyclops Escu Minecoal. But the war she started continues. The Crystalline Knights, now led by 515-year-old Sodel Severeoils (the original reader of Cryptfates), still attack dwarven settlements.

Swordreveres is simply the latest victim—a fortress that existed for less than one day before the old war found it.
