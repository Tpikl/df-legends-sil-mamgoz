# The Fair Inks of Violentwhipped
## A Story of Revival in Year 501

**World:** Sil Mamgoz (The Plane of Dragons)
**Subject:** The new fortress attempting to revive the Tombs-Roads civilization after 342 years of civil war
**Timeline:** Year 500-501
**Scope:** A new king, a new fortress, and seven settlers against the weight of history

---

## Narrative Framework

This is a story of hope against annihilation. For 342 years, the War of Growling has torn the Tombs-Roads of Equivalence apart from within. The necromancer Sodel Severeoils still lives. The Crystalline Knights still attack. And yet—seven dwarves settled at a new fortress. A new king was crowned. Life persists.

**Structure:** A counterpoint to "The Ruin of the Tombs-Roads"

Where that story follows corruption and death, this follows simple dwarves—planters, masons, gem cutters—trying to build something in a world that has been dying for three centuries.

**Central Question:** Can a planter-king, a weaponsmith with a dog, and five women with picks and trowels outweigh centuries of necromantic war?

## Historical Context

### The War of Growling
- Started: Year 159
- Duration: 342 years (as of Year 501)
- Belligerents: The Tombs-Roads of Equivalence vs. The Crystalline Knights (necromancers)
- Status: Ongoing. No end date recorded.

### The Enemy
- **Sodel Severeoils** (hfid 219): The original necromancer. Born Year -15. Still alive.
- **The Crystalline Knights** (Entity 52): The necromancer order at Workboard tower.

### Previous Leadership
The civilization has had many kings over 500+ years. The recent leadership vacuum (Year 500-501 appointments) suggests crisis or transition.

---

## Thematic Elements

### Contrast with "The Ruin of the Tombs-Roads"

| Ruin Story | Fair Inks Story |
|------------|-----------------|
| Necromancers | Farmers, masons, craftsmen |
| The artifact Cryptfates | No artifacts—just skills |
| Corruption passed hand to hand | Simple dwarves settling land |
| Goal: "to rule the world" | Goal: survival |
| Death and undeath | Life and building |
| Characters: Etur, Sodel, Logem | Characters: Kel, Sibrek, Domas |

### The Question

The War of Growling continues. Sodel still lives. The Crystalline Knights still attack. Can seven settlers and a planter-king change anything?

The data says: the fortress was retired after 4 months.

The story asks: what did they build in those 4 months? What walls did Domas raise? What weapons did Sibrek forge? What gems did Litast cut while training her axe arm?

### Character Dynamics

- **Sibrek** (62, weaponsmith): The elder. High charisma. Natural leader among settlers.
- **Morul** (53, wax worker): The manipulator. Second oldest. Different kind of power.
- **Domas** (45, mason): The builder. Brought livestock. Practical.
- **Kib** (41, axeman): The soldier. Only male settler. Mining background.
- **Litast** (24, gem cutter/warrior): Young and deadly.
- **Tobul** (27, gem cutter): Quiet. Competent.
- **Ushat** (27, recruit): Young, given administrative position quickly.

### Faith and Fortune

Most worship practical gods (wealth, earth, fortresses). Only Morul whispers to Nar, goddess of death—and barely.

These are not fanatics or zealots. These are working dwarves who nod at the gods and pick up their tools.

## Notes for Story

- The fortress retired quickly. This is not a victory story—it's a moment.
- Focus on what they tried to build, not whether they succeeded.
- Kel is a planter. Let him think about growing things.
- Sibrek's dog matters. In a world of undead, a loyal dog means something.
- Domas brought sheep and alpaca. Someone planned to stay.
- Morul's skills suggest she's the one who talks to outsiders. Or lies to them.
- Litast can cut gems or cut enemies. At 24, she's already both.
