# The Fair Inks of Violentwhipped

*A story of Year 501 in Sil Mamgoz*

## The Crown No One Wanted

On the first day of spring in Year 501, Kel Gatebreach was made king of the Tombs-Roads of Equivalence.

He did not want the crown. No one did, not anymore. The position had become less a throne and more a target—something painted on your back for the necromancers to aim at. For 342 years the War of Growling had burned through their civilization, and the crown passed from hand to hand like a cursed artifact, each holder wondering when the dead would come for them.

But someone had to wear it, and Kel was there.

He was thirty-four years old. A planter. His hands knew soil and seed, not scepter and ceremony. His highest skill was making things grow, and his god was Idrath, lord of wealth—not because Kel sought riches, but because wealth meant survival. Wealth meant full granaries and warm winters. Wealth meant another generation that didn't starve.

They crowned him at dawn, in whatever passed for a ceremony in those diminished days. The two barons—Bomrek the merchant and Stodir the farmer—stood witness. Bomrek had held the crown himself for a few hours that morning, a brief flicker of succession that left no mark on history. Stodir had been a general, once. Now he farmed. That was the shape of things: soldiers becoming farmers, merchants becoming diplomats, farmers becoming kings.

"What will you do?" Bomrek asked, after the crown was placed.

Kel looked at his hands. Calloused. Dirt under the nails. Not a warrior's hands. Not a statesman's.

"There's a new fortress," he said. "Violentwhipped. Someone needs to make it grow."

## The Seven

They arrived in the middle of the year, when the sun was high and the days long. Seven dwarves, traveling together to a place barely scratched from the mountainside.

**Sibrek Glazepearls** came first, or so she claimed—the eldest at sixty-two, a weaponsmith who walked with a dog at her heels and confidence in her stride. She worshipped Reg, goddess of fortresses and rebirth, and she had the charisma of someone who'd talked her way out of more trouble than she'd fought through. Her forge skill was excellent, but her tongue was sharper than anything she could hammer.

"Violentwhipped," she said, tasting the name as they crested the final hill. "Who names a fortress 'Violentwhipped'?"

"Someone honest," said **Domas Rampartprisons**, the mason, forty-five years old and built like the walls she raised. She'd brought livestock—an alpaca and a sheep, practical beasts for practical purposes. Her hands could shape stone into anything, 15,000 points of masonry skill accumulated over decades. She didn't talk much. When you can build walls that last centuries, words seem temporary.

**Morul Relievechannel** laughed at Sibrek's question, but said nothing. The wax worker was fifty-three, with social skills that didn't match her profession. She could persuade, intimidate, lie, and charm in equal measure. She claimed devotion to Nar, goddess of death, but her faith was so weak as to be nearly absent. Perhaps she'd seen too much death to pray to it anymore. Perhaps she just found the irony amusing.

**Kib Floorbaldness** was the only male among them, forty-one years old, an axeman by title and a miner by skill. He'd been assigned to Squad 2 immediately upon arrival. His faith in Onget was strong—86 points of devotion—and he didn't question orders. He'd swing his axe where they pointed him and dig where they told him to dig. That was enough.

The two gem cutters traveled together. **Litast Oarwhispered** was twenty-four, the youngest, with legendary gem cutting and combat skills that had no business coexisting in someone her age. She could make a gem shine or make an enemy bleed, sometimes in the same hour. **Tobul Bolttrots** was twenty-seven, quiet, competent, unremarkable in every way except that she survived. In a world where survival was art, Tobul was a master.

And finally **Ushat Entrancerag**, twenty-seven years old, a recruit. She had administrative skills, basic farming knowledge, and a position in the new government that she didn't fully understand. She worshipped Risen, goddess of earth, and prayed that the earth would hold them.

Seven dwarves. One dog. One alpaca. One sheep.

Against 342 years of war.

## The Creed of Splitting

The temple was the first building they claimed. They named it the Creed of Splitting—an ambiguous name for an ambiguous time. Splitting from what? The old ways? The main civilization? Each other, eventually?

No one asked. No one answered.

Sibrek's dog explored the new tunnels, sniffing at stone that had never known dwarven feet. Domas began measuring walls, calculating load-bearing capacity, planning expansions that might never happen. Morul found a comfortable spot and started talking to anyone who would listen, mapping the social terrain as surely as Kib mapped the physical.

"The war continues," Morul said, to whoever was near. "Sodel Severeoils still lives. The Crystalline Knights still send their dead against us."

"We know," Tobul said, the first words she'd spoken in days.

"But we're here anyway."

"We know that too."

Morul smiled. It was not a warm expression. "Then you know more than most. Most of our people don't know why they do anything anymore. They just... continue. Like the dead that march against them."

Litast sharpened her axe, listening but not speaking. At twenty-four, she was young enough to have hope and old enough to know better. Her gems were perfect; her combat was deadly. She'd learned both because the world demanded both.

## The Plum of Paddles

They built an inn.

It seemed absurd—an inn, in a fortress that might be overrun by undead at any moment—but Sibrek insisted.

"People need to gather," she said. "People need to drink and talk and remember they're alive. You build temples for the gods. You build inns for the living."

They called it the Plum of Paddles. No one knew why. Someone had suggested the name, and no one had objected, and so it stuck. That was how decisions happened now: not through councils and debate, but through exhaustion and consensus.

Domas built the walls. Kib dug the cellar. Litast carved decorative stonework, her hands switching between fine detail and killing edges without hesitation. Morul managed the logistics—who worked where, who needed rest, who was about to break. Ushat kept records, though she wasn't sure why. Who would read them? Who would care?

Sibrek forged nails, hinges, fixtures. Her dog watched.

When it was done—or done enough—they opened it. The seven of them, raising mugs of whatever they'd managed to brew, in a fortress that might not survive the year.

"To Violentwhipped," Sibrek said.

"To the Fair Inks," Domas added, using their formal name.

"To growing things," said Kel Gatebreach, who had come to see what his subjects had built.

The king sat among them that night, a planter in a room of craftsmen and soldiers, and he did not speak of war or politics or the weight of centuries. He asked about the crops, the livestock, the cellar ventilation. He asked if the walls would hold rain and if the temple had proper drainage.

Domas answered in detail. The others listened.

When he left, Morul watched him go. "A planter-king," she said. "In a world of necromancers."

"Better than a necromancer-king," Sibrek replied.

"Is it?" Morul asked, but she was smiling. "The dead don't starve. The dead don't need drainage."

"The dead don't build inns," Litast said, surprising everyone. It was the most she'd spoken in weeks. "And they don't drink in them."

She raised her mug. After a moment, they all did.

## What They Built

In the four months before the fortress was retired—before whatever happened that ended the experiment—they built walls and cellars and workshops. They built a temple and an inn. They built routines: Kib's patrols, Domas's construction schedules, Sibrek's forge-fires burning into the night.

Litast trained with axe and shield in the mornings, then cut gems until her eyes ached. Tobul worked beside her, silent and steady. Ushat learned administration from Morul, who taught her how to read people as easily as ledgers.

The dog explored every tunnel. The alpaca and sheep grazed whatever grass grew at the fortress entrance. Domas named them, though she never told anyone what she'd named them.

They built lives.

Not forever. Not even for long. But for a moment, in a world that had been dying for three centuries, seven dwarves and a planter-king tried to make something new.

## The Retirement

The records are sparse on what ended it. Year 501, approximately four months after the settlers arrived, Violentwhipped was retired. "First retirement," the chronicles note, as if expecting more.

Did the undead come? Did the settlers abandon their work? Did something else—something the records don't mention—drive them away?

We don't know.

What we know is this: Sibrek Glazepearls, who could forge weapons and charm kings, settled at a new fortress in Year 501. Domas Rampartprisons, whose masonry skill was legendary, built walls there. Litast Oarwhispered, young and deadly, cut gems and trained for war. Kib Floorbaldness dug tunnels and stood ready. Tobul Bolttrots worked in silence. Morul Relievechannel talked her way through crises. Ushat Entrancerag kept records.

They built a temple called the Creed of Splitting and an inn called the Plum of Paddles.

And then the fortress was retired, and the story moved on.

## Coda: The King's Garden

Kel Gatebreach remained king. The records don't say for how long, but they don't record his death either. Somewhere in the Tombs-Roads, a planter wears a crown and worries about drainage.

The War of Growling continues. Sodel Severeoils still lives. The Crystalline Knights still send their dead.

But somewhere, briefly, someone built an inn. Someone named their sheep. Someone forged nails for doors that would swing open and welcome travelers from the dark.

It's not a victory. It's barely even a footnote.

But in a chronicle of 500 years of corruption and war, even a footnote about an inn is something worth remembering.
